0,Cindy Mac,"MedStar Navy Yard is my new go-to for  urgent health care.   I had the worst sinus infection and decided to try out MedStar Navy Yard based on the reviews.  I have to admit, I was skeptical, so I actually did not show up for the first appt the previous day.  But after a bad experience with an urgent care I frequented, I made an appt. What can I say!?  The welcome area and patient rokms were clean and pleasant, and the front desk clerk was hospitable and welcoming.  The nurse who took my blood pressure was quick and efficient, and Dr. Rosetti was attentive with a fantastic bedside manner. I'm glad I gave MedStar a chance.",5,4/15/2025,"Thank you so much for taking the time to share these thoughts, Cindy. We value your feedback and appreciate your taking the time to share it!

1,Bea Hardy,"Dr. Kalra is a very good Doctor. He's all about his business as a doctor, but you first have to come. A lot of us don't want to go, bcuz we don't want to know.  Well, if that's you, Dr. Kalra is not the doctor for you. If you want great care, a doctor who listens, goes over your medical history, ensures you're up-to-date with your vaccines, does follow ups to get you back on track, then come see Dr. Sunil Kalra!

9,Marie Cohen,"My bad experience started when I called shortly after 1:00 PM to find out if Dr. Bailey was running on time and if I should leave for my 1:40 appointment, I did that because I had to wait one hour for my physical last year. I was told she was on time. Once I got to the office and was seen by the nursing assistant, I was told that Dr. Bailey was running 20 minutes late. I was then moved to another exam room. I think she finally got to me about 30 minutes late. As it was last year, I felt that my exam was somewhat abbreviated because of the lateness. (No reflex check, for example). She did check my ears and found that I had a wax buildup, as I suspected. After she was done, Dr. Bailey said the nursing assistant would be back with referrals and to clean my ears of wax, After 30 minutes there was no sign of the nursing assistant so I peeked outside. She was at the computer and said she would be in in a minute. When she arrived, she handed me a stack of referrals and said goodbye. I asked her about my ears and she appeared very suprised and annoyed. She asked me which ear, or both ears. She went out and eventually came back. She did not put a wax-dissolving solution in my ears and have me wait for it to take effect, as is the usual practice,  but simply pumped water into my ears really hard, so hard that I had to tell her several times that it hurt. I don't know how much wax she removed as she did not show me, as is the usual practice, and soon let me go.I do not think she removed all the wax from my ears, as I've been feeling that my left ear is still blocked. It also hurts a bit, perhaps from the forceful administration of water. I'm very, very upset about this entire experience, especially after my one-hour wait a year ago. I will be looking for another practice.",1,12/01/2024,"We are very sorry for your experience when you came to us for care, Marie.

16,Danica Ferguson,"Stuck with them for 2 years but finally hit my breaking point. As a provider you see once a year for an annual physical they are fine. But if you ever need care for acute illness a couple of times a year (i.e. strep throat, UTI) they fail every time to provide adequate, basic treatment. Both times in the two years I had to see them for acute illness I ended up having to follow up and paying to go to urgent care (recommended by their office) for treatment. Mind you this is something they can easily manage, further perpetuating inadequate healthcare resources. I’ve had (very important and timely) labs lost , providers show up late or completely miss appointments altogether, and am altogether treated as a burden rather than a human. None of which have ever even given me the respect of an apology. Too big of a healthcare system, and the providers have gotten too comfortable with it. I’ve never felt so completely unheard nor have I had to fight so hard for basic care. And I’m an RN in DC who has seen it all.",1,01/09/2025,"Thank you for sharing your feedback, Danica.

If you can get in and are able to advocate for yourself, you may get great care here during your actual appointments, but I'm so tired of having to try so hard and wait at least a few months just to be seen, run out of time in the appointment so nothing is accomplished, and get scheduled for a follow-up that then gets pushed out even further by the office.

40,L C,"This place doesn't deserve any stars whatsoever. The front desk personnel are not only incompetent but also highly disrespectful, condescending, and racist. Their attitude is appalling and unacceptable. The wait time for blood work is absurdly long, even though it's just to get blood drawn and not to see a doctor. The level of disorganization and lack of efficiency is astonishing. If you value being treated with basic human decency and respect, steer clear of this place. It's an extremely frustrating and demeaning experience that no one should have to endure. Avoid this place at all costs if you don't want to be treated like dirt.<br><br>As for the Dr. who saw me, here is my letter to her:<br><br>Dear Dr. Sylvia R. Medley,<br><br>I am writing to express my deep disappointment and concern regarding the way you treated me during my recent visit to your clinic. Given your experience and age, it is truly disheartening to see such a lack of compassion and professionalism in your interactions with patients. It is not just your medical education that should guide you to be kind and considerate, but also your life experiences. Unfortunately, my experience with you has left me feeling that you are both heartless and rude.<br><br>During my visit, I felt completely unheard and disregarded. Despite my attempts to communicate my concerns, you essentially instructed me to wait and then never returned to the room. Instead, you sent another staff member who seemed completely unaware of my situation. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a busy clinic where you encounter numerous patients who rely on your care and expertise.<br><br>Given the severity of my experience, I strongly believe that someone with your approach should not be allowed to serve patients in such a high-volume environment. Patients deserve a doctor who listens, understands, and provides compassionate care.",1,6/26/2024,"Lucia, we take your concerns very seriously, and will share them with our leadership team.

51,Hamed Negron,"I have never been treated so rudely at a Dr.'s office. I was called at 7:30 am and rudely asked to change my appointment from 4:40 pm to 4 pm.

The of course at 4 pm no one calls me and I don't have my appointment.

52,Breanna Martin,"Updated Review!<br>Please don’t see this lady Dr. Medley and this office!!!! Turns out the blood results that this ^ doctor failed to provide me support with was precancerous. AGAIN due to her lack of support and preventative medical care which this is the reason why we see a primary care doctor for preventative care, I had to meet with a new supportive doctor through GW Medical office and they supported me through my life-changing events. Plus the office doesn’t hold this behavior accountable, they just will give you a Chipotle gift card after your precancerous blood work is done with no follow up. Please I beg you people, DONT MEET WITH THIS DOCTOR.<br>Follow up-<br>I tried returning for my primary care annual appointment And things did not change. The first issue I had was my primary care doctor didn’t even know that I was scheduled for my annual appointment. I saw my doctor, but only 15 minutes altogether and wasn’t given the proper referrals for issue that I had. I tried to address another Concern Doctor Only to be told by the nurse That the doctor will not see you anymore because they were With another patient. This will be my last time With this office, which is sad I’ve been attending here for 10 years.<br><br>Meet at your on risk, you will only be a number to check off a to-do list and not a individual. Lately it appears that I’m receiving healthcare by email from Dr. Medley. During my appointment on February 1, 2024, it felt like I was at a fast food restaurant only seeing her for 15 minutes for an annual visit. Now I need further support but her next follow up appointment is in April. I wish I had a PCP doctor that cared a little bit about me individually. At this time I choose to locate one. I hate to do this to another black woman, but I truly feel my health will decline under Dr. Medley’s care, she is too busy to notice me.<br><br>Honestly I believe the staff gave everyone a gift card for putting a Five Star review. This has not been my experience with Navy Yard Medstar. Although Dr. Medley is great the medical Front desk staff is the worst. They possess lack of professionalism and care for the client. It takes the staff forever to relay a message to the primary care doctor even respond back.<br>Also, when you arrive to the the customer service is very lackluster<br>The staff forgot to charge me my co-pay then sent my name to Collections",1,01/09/2025,"Thank you for sharing your feedback, Breanna.

73,Angel Ward,"Dr. Bailey (MedStar Team) seeks to provide quality health care. They search deeper to analyze data to better understand the individual needs. It is not a one size fits all approach.

It was an extensive doctor's visit but very much warranted. People generally do not look forward to doctor appointments.

93,Rebecca,"I had high hopes after such a wonderful experience for my initial appointment. The wait was short and the nurse who took my vitals was amazing and super nice- I wish I remembered her name because she deserves a shoutout and a raise. The doctor I saw was nice, but didn’t seem particularly knowledgeable about a prescription I have been prescribed for over a decade, and kept insisting only a psychiatrist could provide me this prescription. I thought that to be offensive because I’ve always had my primary care doctor prescribe me this prescription, and have never been told to see a psychiatrist for this script. However she agreed to write me a refill. Unfortunately she called in the wrong prescription, and despite calling the office everyday for a week I have not received a single update. I was told on Monday this would be remedied within 48 hours. It is now 5 days later. I sent a message yeaterday through the portal to the Dr. asking if she had called the pharmacy to correct the prescription. The response I received back was so insulting. She responded with a list of 10+ psychiatrists with 0 context and no answer to my question. I am feeling really cast aside by the healthcare system and really confused over this. It feels like my medication is being held hostage.

137,Tif,"Ugh. I wasn’t pleased and I’ve love Medstar, both my Mom (who this is for) and I are with the practice. However after 8 months of rescheduled appointments, as a new patient, with Dr Sistrunk she immediately informed us she was no longer taking new patients. We could’ve been informed about this without having to schedule an appointment with the Dr (two of which she previously rescheduled, this was a new patient appointment). I chose her for my mom because of her rating experience and speciality with dementia. She did an evaluation of my mom at the appointment, wasn’t interested in much else we had to say. She spoke incredibly fast and impatiently, cut me off a few times. At the end although she did then ask if I had any questions, at that point I was glad she won’t be my moms Dr but it was a very disappointing appointment.<br><br>The intake staff were great though, and another Dr in the same office, Dr Rochon, he listens and is patient, but doesn’t specialize in dementia.

139,Olivia Babine,"My initial review was 5 stars, then 3 stars, and now 1 star. If I could give 0 stars I would. I first used Dr. Medley with MedStar in Eastern Market (never had problems at that location) and was thrilled with the move to Navy Yard since I live so close by. However, their service has swiftly gone downhill.<br><br>The doctors and nurses are great - I always get good care and I have always been thoroughly pleased with their performance. What makes this location horrendous is the front desk staff, phone staff, and admin staff. Either they don’t care or they are terrible at their job. Here’s a list of the reasons why I’m no longer going to use them anymore.<br><br>1. Even when their is nobody in the waiting room, I’m forced to wait 20-30+ minutes for a pre-scheduled appointment.<br><br>2. While they have zero problem making patients wait 20-30+ minutes when their is no wait, they won’t extend the same courtesy when you’re 15-30 minutes late to an appointment and will force you to reschedule.<br><br>3. I’m always forced to fill out admin documents which I’ve already been prompted to fill out online and have already completed.<br><br>4. I have reached out with health questions on the online portal and have on occasion received no response or an extraordinarily delayed response.<br><br>5. The worst of all - it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get through the phone lines. It rings and rings for eternity or goes to voicemail making it impossible talk to a human when necessary. For example, I got into a bad scooter accident over Thanksgiving which resulted in a concussion and broken nose.<br><br>The ER doctor gave me explicit instructions to schedule a PCP follow up in three days. I called in and could never get through. So, I walked in to schedule an appointment and they wouldn’t schedule me for another week despite the severity of the injury resulting in delayed care.<br><br>6. They have no professionalism. I once went in for an annual and when I left the discharge papers given to me were for another patient which had personal information on it. A clear HIPPA violation. When they called me today to reschedule my annual physical they asked me if I was a new patient - I’ve been a patient for five years. More importantly, they were asking to reschedule an appointment time they offered and booked me on their own. The replacement time was for over one month out.",1,12/30/2021,"Olivia, thank you for updating your review. We are sorry for your experience and take your concerns very seriously.

Medstar has a great online portal to communicate with the Dr., but even when Dr. Bailey asks the nurse/office staff to respond... still nothing.

162,Gordon Michalson,"Excellent experience, with friendly and professional staffers, an impressive primary care physician, and, to my happy surprise, no waiting.  As a new arrival in the area, I was concerned it would be challenging to find a primary care physician who fit my needs.  I lucked out with my choice.  Dr. Rochon's friendly staff very thouroughly worked me through my medical history, while Dr. Rochon himself spent an unusually long time discussing my background and health issues, examining me, and providing me contact information for specialists in areas of relevance to my situation.  He is relaxed in manner, a good listener, and unrushed.  Plus he has a sense of humor, not always the case with physicians as they hurry through their day.",5,1/27/2023,"Thank you so much for your kind words, Gordon. Your review made our day!

163,Christopher Thompson,"I am incredibly surprised by the number of positive reviews. Let me share with you my experience.<br><br>In October I required a refill for blood pressure medicationn. I called Medstar for a new prescription and they mentioned I needed to see the doctor in order to get a new prescription. That has never happened with previous physicians for this medication. It was a problem because my next appointment with Dr. Emile Rochon was a month away. I asked that they contact Dr. Rochon to see if he could provide a new prescription before our next appointmentt. There was no return phone call and I followed up twice after that call. I ended up running out of blood pressure medication for a whole month prior to our appointment.<br><br>Just recently, I called Medstar three times for a doctor referral. And there has been no follow-up again and we're going on week two...<br><br>Highly recommend training is conducted for all members to follow-up with patient inquiries.

178,Kyle Olson,"As others have said, great doctors but subpar service. Curious how the management continues to acknowledge these reviews but it seems as if the level of service hasn't improved. Where do I start...<br><br>1) Person over phone who I made appointment with told me a different address/Medstar location. My email confirmation had the Navy Yard address. Had to call and confirm Navy Yard was indeed accurate.<br>2) Showed up 20 minutes early as directed only to find a sign saying they are having a meeting and won't be open until later.<br>3) Someone let us in eventually and then did not give clear direction to people to check in... just told us to sit down. This resulted in confusion and frustration when she then just shouted ""next"" and people who were here after us walked up to check in.<br>4) Overheard both receptionists unprofessionally arguing with each other of whether or not they should have let us in, they are missing their meeting, etc.",1,03/11/2022,"Kyle, thank you for your review and feedback.

219,Jonathan Addison,My doctor Dr Mullner is an amazing doc who I would give 5 stars to. This one star review is for MedStar and specific to this location. Why a MedStar would choose a location with absolutely no parking makes no sense and especially when street parking is non-existent And no public garages. Spent 35 minutes trying to find a space which I did....12 blocks away. Additionally you cannot reach anyone by phone at this location to inquire with them about the possibility of parking. Best advice I can give anyone is to not book to come here. You’ll get frustrated with just trying to find parking. Just go elsewhere.,1,7/30/2020,"Thank you for your review and feedback, Jonathan.

230,Joel Siegel,"If I could leave a ""Zero"" star review, I would.<br><br>I had the displeasure of visiting a Medstar Promptcare facility where I was given incorrect information. The result was me getting charged an extra $200 for a simple follow up visit that resulted in an extra xray and the provider telling me to ""go to an orthopedic."" For that, I was charged $200. I called for 2 weeks in an attempt to speak to the facility administrator. I finally got a number to call her directly. I called Ms. Gregg on 2 occasions and sent two e-mails. After not hearing from her for 1.5 weeks, I decided to call and lodge a complaint against her and the facility for misrepresentation of services and an ethics complaint for her not returning my calls. Within 24 hours after this complaint, I got a call from Zal who was most helpful in explaining how everything worked. He said he did not know why Ms. Gregg did not return my phone calls, but offered to help me discern the breakdown of costs and see what the rates would be if I were directly billed instead of through insurance. He explained that the costs would have been higher through Aetna anyways, and that Aetna's global rate for their urgent care facilities is meant to keep costs down, that is of course unless you only go in for a follow up in which case the costs are MUCH higher than your normal primary care physician (I know this because I called a local physician's office here in PG county). On top of this, as I began to state that I just simply will not go to another Medstar Facility, he said ""well, this isn't really a Medstar issue, it's the high deductible health plan issue. You could have a lower co-pay and that's your only responsibility."" Which just set me off. How DARE you try to tell me what I COULD have! The ACA made it impossible for me to afford such healthcare because I make too much money to be allowed to get governmental assistance and yet I don't make enough to afford a $200 follow-up visit to your facility. So what did I learn from Medstar? It's not that I was given incorrect information from the provider...it's the fact that I can't afford any other health plans except for an HDHP.

253,Nelson Oliveira,"Dr. Aleskow is one of the very best internists in the region — a doctor’s doctor.  He has a library of Knowledge and experience that he brings to the most routine of examinations, and the rigor and logic that he brings to sorting through the  myriad health issues in my life is unlike any PCP or internist I have Known. Some may find his intensity off-putting, as I once did when I first became his patient 25 years ago.  Of course, nothing could be less important given the wealth of intelligence and attention to detail behind that intensity.  Moreover, his network of specialists to whom he can refer his patients is second to none.  When my spine collapsed last year due to multiple myeloma, I lacked the mobility to see him in person in his downtown DC office, so I began seeing a PCP located next to my oncologist’s office in Reston.  That experience provided a stark reminder of the quality of care I have been receiving from Dr. Aleskow over all these years, and I was delighted and relieved to return to his care this year.",5,04/09/2025,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117926044646436991033/reviews?hl=en-US,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXIkSPEcCO5p4ht9s3RFSQpQjF1HXlCVOpg_In84iT0EYHTs5dU=s64-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-US&gl=us&q=Comprehensive+Primary+Care+-+L+Street,+1920+L+St+NW+Suite+350,+Washington,+DC+20036&ludocid=17611306987473258258&lsig=AB86z5XLZdLzqCny6zFoHCl_di4a&_rs_=1#lrd=0x89b7b7cf7fe01627:0xf467ee657ab2c712,1",positive,20036,17611,30698,74732,58258,1627,,,,District of Columbia

273,Eric N.,"I was a patient of CPC for the past 14 years. They have good doctors , but the quality of the service at the office deteriorated drastically over the years. I have recently selected a new PCP. Unfortunately, the office has turned into a mechanical conveyor where you can't have your PCP's attention. During the last physical check appointment I had they have booked 4 other patients at the same time, so 4 of us sat in 3 separate rooms while a doctor they scheduled appoint for was desperately running back and forth between 4 different patients. Needless to say, neither of us got the treatment we came for. That is aside from the fact that I had to wait an hour for my turn to be briefly/momentarily seen. Last few years they also stopped giving authorizations to refill, so you are forced to call every three months and schedule a video visit to get your refill authorized. At one point my prescribing doctor was arguing with her own staff who were refusing to process HER request for refill, because the admin staff was adamant on scheduling unnecessary appointment (just a month after I took last labs). That is how desperate CPC is to charge your insurance company without any reason or need for it. I would stay away from PCP and find a better practice where it's not your insurance dollars but you as a patient matter.",1,10/17/2024,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101725379039076738565/reviews?hl=en-US,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJfvIyFCf5_ubAYVRVFehAgS5QRXwfl1CL5Wd2zOY9DqyxvnQ=s64-c-rp-mo-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-US&gl=us&q=Comprehensive+Primary+Care+-+L+Street,+1920+L+St+NW+Suite+350,+Washington,+DC+20036&ludocid=17611306987473258258&lsig=AB86z5XLZdLzqCny6zFoHCl_di4a&_rs_=1#lrd=0x89b7b7cf7fe01627:0xf467ee657ab2c712,1",negative,20036,17611,30698,74732,58258,1627,,,,District of Columbia

They weren’t exaggerating - I’ve never, ever had a conversation with a doctor of Dr. Hansen’s caliber.  Her clinical and practical expertise shine.  She answered all of my questions, educated my assumptions, and advocated my health and wellness plans.  She truly is part of the foundation I’m building for a healthier future, and with her (and Kim!) on my side, I know I’ll reach my goals.  I can’t recommend Comprehensive enough - it’s been literally life-changing for me.  Thanks Dr. Hansen!

Establishing continuity of care is very important to me and so I was extremely displeased with overall experience at the U Street Office; from the lack of professionalism and the inconsitency in the care I would receive; I always felt like I was seeing a different Doctor every time I went to the U Street location and for someone like myself who struggles with anxiety and depression that was so incredibly frustrating because I would essentially have to explain my whole situation and treatment plan all over again every time which creates a deep lack of faith that I am being properly treated and followed up with accordingly. The L Street Office is such an incredible improvement from my previous horrible experiences with the U Street Office. Dr.Abbas and the L Street staff are incredibly professional, helpful, and attentive to their patients and their individual needs; they respond to calls, medication refill requests, appointment/reminders and everything in a very timely manner; I have never had any issues and/or difficulties contacting this office and getting whatever I have needed. Also, Dr.Abbas is very professional and compassionate provider; he is very dedicated to each patient and every appointment is thorough; you never feel as though you are getting rushed through it and he always ensures that you are given the appropriate time and care to voice any concerns and ask any question. There is always a sense of comfort in knowing that it's not just a ""check-up"" with Dr.Abbas; it is actually continuity of care.

359,Whitney Murray,"Dr. Abbas performed my USCIS Immigration Medical Examination and I couldn't have been more disappointed with his services and this clinic. Multiple parts on my sealed medical exam written by Dr. Abbas were missing and/or incomplete - I only found this out during my Immigration Interview after they opened the sealed file and this was the only reason I did not pass on the spot. Shame on you, you should not hold this special designation to perform this exam when you lack accountability, professionalism and ultimately care. I urge you not to come here for your medical needs, if he can be this negligent over a simple and basic form for a healthy young woman what will he miss for someone who is ill? Not only did he waste my $500+ for this exam, he wasted my time and efforts & kept me away from visiting my family back home for extra months. When I asked the clinic for any form of refund the lady at the front desk just laughed at me.",1,12/02/2022,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103494070088042877218/reviews?hl=en-US,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUQVqSe7jTCZ_Us4h5qT0jXRVd964uCEZGwCgSK0mcfvUNHXM64=s64-c-rp-mo-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-US&gl=us&q=Comprehensive+Primary+Care+-+L+Street,+1920+L+St+NW+Suite+350,+Washington,+DC+20036&ludocid=17611306987473258258&lsig=AB86z5XLZdLzqCny6zFoHCl_di4a&_rs_=1#lrd=0x89b7b7cf7fe01627:0xf467ee657ab2c712,1",negative,20036,17611,30698,74732,58258,1627,,,,District of Columbia

The doors to the building were locked so I called and the woman on the phone let me know that office was closed today. I asked why and how I was allowed to make an appointment, and she told me I was confused and must have just requested one. I then read her my confirmation email and she had nothing to say and did not even apologize. I continued to ask how this was possible and if I could be seen at another location, as all of their other offices were open. She told me I could not, and asked when I'd like to be rescheduled for. When I was explaining that I did not know when I could reschedule for, as I had to once again take time off work, she hung up on me.

He is responsive, thorough, and genuinely cares for the well being of all of his patients.  I have seen a range of physicians throughout the years and truly no one holds a candle to his knowledge, approach and bedside manner.

He works for the patient always and with such heart and responsiveness like I have never seen.

500,Ann Zabaldo,"Internal Medicine at MedStar Washington DC Hospital; Center is a well run clinic. Although I could see my :primary Care Physician in his private practice I prefer the clinic.  Having a lab on site is just one of the conveniences -- no hunting a lab making another appointment and then going to said lab.<br><br>But what I REALLY like is that this clinic is part of Washington Hosptal which is a teaching hospital.  This means in the clinic I often see a Resident in addition to my PCP.  I like the mix of doctors on their way to starting their independent careers.<br><br>For me, different viewpoints is a plus.  Visits w/ a resident is always followed up w/ my PCP.  After seeing the resident they confer w/ my PCP.  Then both of them return to report on their analyses and recommendations.   This means I see TWO professionals and get a lot longer than 15 minutes where the physician is greeting me on the way into the exam room and summarizing their recommendations on their  way out the door to their next 15 minute appointment.<br><br>The clinic also takes Medicare and Medicaid.  No small feat these days.<br><br>Sometimes the waiting room is overstuffed with people waiting for their appointment and you.wonder when your name will be called.<br><br>Sometimes I have to wait to start the appointment. If you have some patience I believe you will find the pluses of using the clinic as beneficial as I do.

The first lady with the headwrap drew my blood and during the stick she went through my vein (I'm on blood thinners) and caused a huge hematoma. Once I was finished I left and had gotten almost to Ga. Ave and received a call from the person that had just drawn my blood stating that I needed to come back because she missed a tube and needed to draw one more. Totally unacceptable!!!!<br>Upon arriving back to the lab one of the other phlebotomists drew my blood 3 more tubes. I'm still not quite sure why so much blood was drawn the second time.<br>I understand that sometimes people make mistakes, but to me this was huge...I had to come back to the hospital, find parking, wait again to be called with a huge mark on my arm...and I am not a fan of getting my blood drawn.",3,4/21/2025,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, Ericka.

507,Arieana “Ari” Love,Had my 1st appt to establish care here and had an awful experience. I went to the downstairs clinic with the residents/interns. I was told I’d see a resident and then see the doctor I was scheduled with. No one told me I wasn’t going to see the doctor I was scheduled with or so much as mentioned her name during my appt. I needed referrals for specialists in the area since I just moved and the (male) resident Dr. Torosian literally argued with me on why they weren’t necessary (even though other more senior providers have told me I need to see these specialists). He was so rude and dismissive of my medical history and he barely even looked at me during my appt.   I’ve never felt so embarrassed to bring a medical concern to a provider in my life. Would not recommend this clinic. Seems chaotic and unorganized.<br><br>I already plan to file a complaint with the hospital.,1,04/05/2025,"Hi Arieana, we're truly sorry to hear this.

694,Ballina Koroilavesau,"17 Sep, on/about 10:30pm - This is specifically for the check in desk and triage nurse.  We were transferred from another ER since they didn’t have an eye doctor and the medical team called ahead to let the team know we were coming and to take us directly to the eye doctor vs waiting in the ER waiting room for a possible emergency surgery.  Upon checking in and explaining everything to the front desk, with no bed side manner or people skills, says “you have 157 people ahead of you and we are busy you need to wait”.  I totally get they have a procedure, but if I explained everything and had a sealed envelope, why wouldn’t you call the eye clinic to confirm?  Instead we got a nasty attitude… in the medical field or customer service field, it is so important to have people skills that will allow them to be at ease and most important to have good listening and communicative skills to better help the patient and medical field in general.",1,9/17/2024,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115182952590279508766/reviews?hl=en-US,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVrsznoehJAncltM2wIkRRHlzjvdTuGRiaQj7yvdTiX4GFeFEqx=s64-c-rp-mo-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-US&gl=us&q=Washington+Hospital+Center:+Dubree+Kevin+J,+110+Irving+St+NW,+Washington,+DC+20010&ludocid=17640916542642867237&lsig=AB86z5VzvSE_zACfsBoBw-egzaIR&_rs_=1#lrd=0x89b7c8014a9b6997:0xf4d12021448a4c25,1",negative,20010,17640,91654,26428,67237,12021,,,,District of Columbia

697,Cynthia Willis,"The service was pristine, beginning with the receptionist, my primary care assistant, my primary care doc, Dr. Francisco King. The phlebotomy staff and the receptionists. I  loved their professionalism, and you get the feeling and comfort that they cared. Dr. King was awesome. He listened and engaged you in the conversations, which made you feel comfortable speaking to him  about yourself, your health, and any progress that you think you have made. Its very important for patients to have these interactions with their provider and team. Whether you receive a great report card or one that's not so good, leaving with a feeling that you are in good hands with the service your care team provides means a lot to any patient.

Unfortunately, one of their Doctors, Sarah Elizabeth Rimm (Bolan) and RN Shirley treated me with such distaste and unprofessionalism that I have decided, and now my immediate family as well, have decided not to use MedStar. Dr. Rimm shunned me when I arrived in the ER with acute DKA. Had she actually attempted to treat me with compassion and respect she would have known that I had just left the ER less than 12 hours prior, where I was told if I were to experience ANY of the symptoms I had originally presented with, to come back immediately. It turns out my A1C was 16 and my sugars were over 650!

All contact info for doctors and nurse practitioners on their website is outdated. The website itself seems intentionally hard to use. I had the best experience with One Medical. Not only was it effortless to schedule an appointment (for the next day nonetheless!), my new primary care provider is focused on preventive medicine, which is exactly what I have been wanting to find (so rare in this country). Without my having to ask she ordered blood work that previous doctors denied to me even though I begged for them. The appointment started exactly on time and the bloodwork was done right after. I also love how all of the lab results are accessible in the One Medical app and how I can message my PCP directly. Lastly, the integration with Amazon Pharmacy makes it seemless to order my thyroid meds and to keep my dose in check. I could not recommend One Medical more strongly. The price is so friendly for prime subscribers. I will never use any other service for my health needs.",5,3/15/2025,"Hi, Paula. Thank you so much for your generous feedback!

962,Joe Doyle,"At my last appointment, my PCP, Esther Baik, accused me of seeking surgical intervention for scoliosis (which I don’t desire) because I was wary about her recommendation of acupuncture for back and neck issues and she also warned me against trying to get her to “say bad things” about other doctors when trying to get a recommendation for a specialist. When I first started seeing her, about a year ago, I asked if she could prescribe a pretty common and manageable anxiety medication, one that I had experience with in the past, and she said she wouldn’t prescribe it because she didn’t “want to have to keep up with that.” I was to understand that “keeping up with that” is part of a doctor’s job, but perhaps I’ve been mistaken. If anything, that incident alone should have told me everything I needed to know about the quality of care I would be receiving from Esther and One Medical.<br><br>Additionally, One Medical’s subscription appears to have cost me double what it’s supposed to cost Prime members, so there are administrative issues, too.

971,Victoria Zay,"This visit was a complete failure and disappointment on so many levels. To start, my PCP, Jennifer, never even introduced herself to me so I did not even know the person I was seeing at first was my PCP. My whole appointment was completely rushed (clearly since we did not even introduce ourselves) and I was out the door within 20 minutes or so. This was my first appointment with this PCP so I certainly expected more care and patience to begin with. I booked an appointment for a physical and was immediately told at the beginning of the appointment that the physical would not be happening because she had to fill out medical records even though I had completed all the required forms beforehand. After briefly covering one of the issues I was having and needed a referral for, I was rushed out the door and told to book another appointment for a physical - even though this appointment was scheduled to be a physical. During my checkout I made it clear that I booked a physical and did not receive one and was frustrated. I should not have to book another appointment, pay another copay, and take time off of work, just to have the physical that I originally booked for. This was completely unprofessional and although I voiced my grievances and frustrations with Jennifer as well as the receptionists, no one took my concerns seriously or initiated any corrective actions. It took another person from One Medical calling me to check back in on an unrelated matter for my concern to be heard and taken seriously. It was also then disclosed that the appointment was being billed as a physical to the insurance even though I clearly did not receive a physical and made it abundantly clear to the receptionist that it cannot and should not be billed as one since I did not receive a physical and did not want to use my yearly physical appointment for a physical I didn't receive. This was a truly awful and mishandled experience. I expected and deserved much more care and respect from all parties involved.",1,10/13/2022,"Hi Viki!<br><br>My name is Jordan and I'm the office manager at our Union Station office.

They over subscribe their providers and seemingly leave them with very little to no time to actually get to know their patients and their issues.

They've delayed referrals for urgent scans, so as to get pre authorization my insurance company openly states are not necessary.

981,Liz Burman McEntire,"Five stars isn't enough! I don't write many reviews here, but I'm continuously amazed by how wonderful the services provided by one medical are. I am a woman in my late 20's and while I'm reasonably healthy, I have a few mild to moderately annoying health issues. I decided to sign up for one medical because they are convenient to my office and I can see someone same day if I am not feeling well. Since joining in a few months ago, I've been blown away by how great and comprehensive the care has been. When I wasn't feeling well they saw me immediately, actually listened to my concerns, provided great care, and followed up quickly and clearly. They are the most organized and thoughtful group of medical professionals I've ever encountered. When I had a brief health scare, they scheduled me for a follow up within a week of diagnosis and after I expressed anxiety with the scheduler I was called by both an incredibly knowledgeable and empathetic nurse practitioner AND MY DOCTOR to help me feel secure, cared for, and informed.<br><br>The mobile app is great (and works better than any app I've seen from Aetna, care first, or united healthcare). All messages and lab results come right to my phone and I get a notification when I have a new message. If I have questions about a treatment I can email a nurse at any time either using my personal email or the app and someone from one medical, be it a nurse or my PCP Dr Jillian Noyes herself email me back within about 24 hours.<br><br>Most recently two encounters have reaffirmed my love for this office. The first was when I went to see a specialist at my doctors referral. When I arrived I realized that I had forgotten to print my referral. As I was asking if I could forward my referral email, they asked if I was coming from one medical and pulled out a referral that had already been faxed for me! The second was when I was talking with an old friend and she told me that she'd found a new doctor that she loved. Before I'd over told her that I had also switched primary care physicians, she asked ""have you heard about one medical, they are incredible!""<br><br>Since joining One Medical, I have referred them to all of my closest friends.

985,Lawrence Tong,"I have been a subscriber for two years. I have never had a problem with the staff, PAs, NPs or MDs. However, when I received an erroneous bill last month, I could not get through to a person via the admin chat thread in the app (or website on my laptop) nor could I reach a person in the NJ Ave office when I called their 202 line listed above. It defaulted to One Medical’s general line—which I called last week to inquire about the bill. I waited an hour to get a person on the phone last week and forty minutes to get, as it turns out, the same person who remembered our original conversation. Last week she told me my insurance was billed, according to her computer, and they did not receive an insurance payment. I told her I only owe a copay and she agreed. She asked me to call my insurance company to inquire about it. I thought to myself: why do I pay a membership fee? I asked her to do it on my behalf and she said she would. I never received an update. Today, I called my insurance first to confirm that they never received a bill from One Medical (they had not). When I asked the OneMedical rep about it, she said she had spoken with someone at my insurance co. who said she would follow up and did not indicate yea or nay whether they received a bill. When I informed her that I also spoke with someone and the answer was definitely ‘no,’ I asked her to resubmit the request. She was perfectly polite both times I spoke with her but she is clearly inexperienced with medical billing (or overwhelmed—how could I get the same c/s rep twice?) The bottom line is I pay $199 per year for what seems like a nice office to visit with relatively easy access to a provider (but not often an appt with a provider of my choice). Furthermore, I have to spend additional time trying to correct someone else’s mistake. So, where is the value in One Medical? I’m cancelling my membership as soon as I get the correct amount on this bill paid and rolling the dice with a regular primary care practice again.",1,02/08/2021,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103947514650725052816/reviews?hl=en-US,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWeztvScmpZOAER_8eUj3nCZu2DYvLMujnV0Ofl5ZS5w1zWyZY=s64-c-rp-mo-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-US&gl=us&q=One+Medical:+Union+Station,+601+New+Jersey+Ave+NW+%23200,+Washington,+DC+20001&ludocid=9132732940084710297&lsig=AB86z5Uiwfm4qzMkvTqnv7nlNKkg&_rs_=1#lrd=0x89b7b789f242842d:0x7ebdfc38c2420b99,1",negative,23200,20001,91327,32940,8471,24284,,,,Virginia
