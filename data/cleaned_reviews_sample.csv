"MedStar Navy Yard is my new go-to for  urgent health care.   I had the worst sinus infection and decided to try out MedStar Navy Yard based on the reviews.  I have to admit, I was skeptical, so I actually did not show up for the first appt the previous day.  But after a bad experience with an urgent care I frequented, I made an appt. What can I say!?  The welcome area and patient rokms were clean and pleasant, and the front desk clerk was hospitable and welcoming.  The nurse who took my blood pressure was quick and efficient, and Dr. Rosetti was attentive with a fantastic bedside manner. I'm glad I gave MedStar a chance.",positive
"Dr. Kalra is a very good Doctor. He's all about his business as a doctor, but you first have to come. A lot of us don't want to go, bcuz we don't want to know.  Well, if that's you, Dr. Kalra is not the doctor for you. If you want great care, a doctor who listens, goes over your medical history, ensures you're up-to-date with your vaccines, does follow ups to get you back on track, then come see Dr. Sunil Kalra! He's Awesome & yes, he does all that! He's not about rushing you; He ensures you understands before you walk away.",positive
"Dr. Janelle Leuschen is knowledgeable, patient, compassionate, communicative, and efficient. She addressed all of my concerns with clear instructions. She was thorough and very helpful. This clinic is also well managed. You can easily book appointments with the front desk or on your phone. You can access your records on your portal. I intend to continue my relationship with this clinic and Dr. Leuschen long-term. Very satisfied!",positive
"Very efficient operation - making an appointment, checking in and checking out was very fast. The tech staff and Dr. Glaser were warm and professional, and I was able to finally understand the nature of and remedies for my pain. My visit even included x-rays and the whole visit from start to finish was barely 30 minutes.",positive
"Everything from check in to Dr. visit to lab work was the best timely experience.  Secondly, each person was so kind.  Dr. did not hurry me along. Nice experience.",positive
"The staff was very pleasant and welcoming.  I love Dr. Sistrunk . She is very compassionate and thorough.  Most importantly, I was finished my appointment in a timely manner.",positive
Dr. Bailey is such a great doctor with great bed side manner and truly care about her patients.  I highly recommend Dr. Bailey.<br><br>I have not met any doctor as thorough and caring as Dr. Bailey.  She takes her time to ensure that she is checking everything.  She is the type of doctor who truly cares so I don't care waiting for her.<br>If you want a thorough caring and empathetic doctor then I highly recommend Dr. Bailey.,positive
The new doctor was great . The lab technician was fast and efficient..The only place where they can draw my blood without multiple attempts.  Reception people were helpful. Using Medstar for over 20 yrs.. new facility at the Navy  Yard is nicer than the old one  at Eastern Market,positive
"Dr. Sylvia Medley has been my Primary Care Physician for over 13 years. I have come to rely on her for all of my medical needs, no matter what the situation. She is my go-to physician and an excellent provider. I highly recommend Medstar Health professionals to take care of your health and wellness. Schedule an appointment with a physician or specialist today!",positive
"My bad experience started when I called shortly after 1:00 PM to find out if Dr. Bailey was running on time and if I should leave for my 1:40 appointment, I did that because I had to wait one hour for my physical last year. I was told she was on time. Once I got to the office and was seen by the nursing assistant, I was told that Dr. Bailey was running 20 minutes late. I was then moved to another exam room. I think she finally got to me about 30 minutes late. As it was last year, I felt that my exam was somewhat abbreviated because of the lateness. (No reflex check, for example). She did check my ears and found that I had a wax buildup, as I suspected. After she was done, Dr. Bailey said the nursing assistant would be back with referrals and to clean my ears of wax, After 30 minutes there was no sign of the nursing assistant so I peeked outside. She was at the computer and said she would be in in a minute. When she arrived, she handed me a stack of referrals and said goodbye. I asked her about my ears and she appeared very suprised and annoyed. She asked me which ear, or both ears. She went out and eventually came back. She did not put a wax-dissolving solution in my ears and have me wait for it to take effect, as is the usual practice,  but simply pumped water into my ears really hard, so hard that I had to tell her several times that it hurt. I don't know how much wax she removed as she did not show me, as is the usual practice, and soon let me go.I do not think she removed all the wax from my ears, as I've been feeling that my left ear is still blocked. It also hurts a bit, perhaps from the forceful administration of water. I'm very, very upset about this entire experience, especially after my one-hour wait a year ago. I will be looking for another practice.",negative
"I didn't feel like a patient next in line to be picked and probed. Doctor Rochon was pleasant and we talked, not like doctor to patient, but person to person.<br>I asked questions out of curiosity and he provided answers with an explanation and gaves examples.<br>He reviewed my health history and followed up with questions to confirm or otherwise. I felt like he was concerned and not about hurrying up to get to the next person or just be done for the day<br>As for those needles, the procedures were necessary but that part of the appointment was not so nice ‚òùüèΩ!",positive
"The front desk staff helped me get in to see sports doc Dr. Glazer on short notice (to deal w a sudden severe knee pain).  He was very efficient and supportive in his exam and treatment, listening to my explanation and responding clearly and helpfully. The pain went away pretty much on its own (w help of a med that Dr G prescribed) over the next 2 weeks. 6 weeks later I saw him for a follow-up in which he was again very helpful. (Thankfully the knee is OK now and I better understand how to take care of it.). Many thanks to Dr G and all staff who helped w this episode.",positive
My appointment with Dr. Medley went very smooth. Dr. Medley addressed all my concerns and gave me good advice on how  to improve my health. She listens and respond appropriately. I would highly recommend her.,positive
"My experience was very positive from registration and until end of appointment .<br>The MA was professional/ nice / explained everything during exam. Dr. Rochon, greeted w a smile/ introduced himself. Dr. Rochon, made me feel like could open/ honest during appointment. He explained what my care plan would be moving forward .  Happily to be his patient and the entire team.  The lab tech was professional/ explained everything prior to lab draw.  MA, was outstanding made sure had all documents upon checkout.<br>When returned home received phone call from Radiology to schedule procedures.<br>I am pleased to say my visit was good experience.  The customer service is from staff was100%.  Medical Administration is my career 40 years , always greet the customer w a smile. Patient service starts at the receptionist area.  Thanks to the advocate who let me in the building. I was the first pt there and kudos to Dr. Rochon and his team.",positive
Dr. Leuschen is always an amazing person each visit. She has a great bedside manner and really engages with you on your health journey to make decisions appropriate for your life. I‚Äôm grateful to have her as my doctor.,positive
My Dr was very professional and personable. I felt like she really cared about me and was genuinely interested and invested in my physical and mental health!,positive
"Stuck with them for 2 years but finally hit my breaking point. As a provider you see once a year for an annual physical they are fine. But if you ever need care for acute illness a couple of times a year (i.e. strep throat, UTI) they fail every time to provide adequate, basic treatment. Both times in the two years I had to see them for acute illness I ended up having to follow up and paying to go to urgent care (recommended by their office) for treatment. Mind you this is something they can easily manage, further perpetuating inadequate healthcare resources. I‚Äôve had (very important and timely) labs lost , providers show up late or completely miss appointments altogether, and am altogether treated as a burden rather than a human. None of which have ever even given me the respect of an apology. Too big of a healthcare system, and the providers have gotten too comfortable with it. I‚Äôve never felt so completely unheard nor have I had to fight so hard for basic care. And I‚Äôm an RN in DC who has seen it all.",negative
"I came here feeling absolutely miserable, after filling out the registration and paperwork online for my appointment. The nurse at the front desk was incredibly mean to me and raised her voice at me for ""not filling out the paperwork"", even though I submitted the paperwork and received the balloons page online. It was really bizarre. There were 2 other people in the lobby and I ended up waiting over an hour to be seen once I got back into a room in addition to the extended wait in the lobby (despite arriving a few minutes early). I would not return here unless there was no other place to go.<br><br>yes, this was at the primary care office in navy yard.",negative
My appointment was 3pm come early because I didn‚Äôt where I was going. Front desk able to take me an hour early  to see Dr. Deklotz he was so nice and able to explain everything  to me where I can understand what was my problem and his asst He was good as well<br>Thank you for taking care of me and fill me in for early appointment . Thank you,positive
"Dr Meghane and the technician, Tasleem were both excellent and super helpful. I had come in due to a chest injury and they made me feel really comfortable. Kudos to the MedStar team!",positive
"Have requested appointments multiple times for weeks, but have yet to hear back even once.<br><br>Wish they were as responsive as they are to positive reviews on here.",negative
Monica is always so helpful in facilitating my appointment. Dr. Kalra is knowledgeable and has great bed side manner.,positive
"Clean, spacious reception area/waiting room; userfriendly electronic sign in (same features/format as pre-visit check-in - HINT save time during office visit by completing previsit check-in); warm welcoming and professional front desk service, nursing staff/technicians and physician; timely placement in patient room; convenient on-site lab services on-site with easy online registration and processing; quick, comprehensive visit summary w/ referrals and recommendations.",positive
Dr Kalra is the most compassionate person I know. He takes the time to understand the issue and will offer options for addressing the condition.,positive
"I have never had a doctor that I'm as comfortable with as Shryl Sistrunk. She really listens, takes her time (when she can), and has a sense of humor.  I trust her.",positive
Dr. Medley is always right on time and spends quality time with me. She makes connections between issues by really listening to her patients.,positive
"I like that appointments stay on schedule and that lab work is done at the same location within minutes. Also, Dr. Bailey and staff display the utmost professionalism.",positive
"I went to this appointment with concerns over lab results and questions and when I tried to discuss a plan with the physician he indicated he could not help me and did not have a recommendation.   When I asked about a time frame for some other lab results based on his experience, his response was not helpful and stated it was beyond his control/. There was no need for this appointment as I already read the results and understand them as I am a nurses.I will be seeking a new place to obtain care.  So disappointed and frustrated.<br><br>The medical assistant was so kind and caring.  He made me feel welcomed and at ease.  He was friendly and listened and he was amazing!!",negative
"Telehealth visits are very convenient, but a little confusing to know when it starts.  I needed a step between the appointment and when the doctor was ready to start.",positive
"The staff themselves are kind and competent, but this location appears to be entirely overworked with far too many patients for the available doctors. After a year of being a patient here, I am moving on to another primary care provider after repeated issues around getting appointments, having my formerly scheduled appointments rescheduled by the office (pushed out a month from the original scheduled date), and a general lack of follow-up by my providers. If you can get in and are able to advocate for yourself, you may get great care here during your actual appointments, but I'm so tired of having to try so hard and wait at least a few months just to be seen, run out of time in the appointment so nothing is accomplished, and get scheduled for a follow-up that then gets pushed out even further by the office. I truly hope this practice gets more providers to appropriately manage their case load and do not recommend any patients with chronic or complex health issues pursue care here until they do.",negative
On behalf of my husband Nathaniel Hayes Dr Rochon was an excellent caring  doctor who will sit down and go over ever details and concerns you may have.,positive
Medstar has some Great Doctors.My Primary was Doctor was able to make me an appointment with a Specialist 2 hours after my appointment with him.That's what you call going above and beyond Service,positive
"Dr. Sunil Kalra is my primary doctor and I don‚Äôt have any concerns or issues with the care I‚Äôve been provided.  He‚Äôs an excellent doctor, patient, and thorough.  Appreciate his completeness.",positive
Dr. Systrunk was able to see me in between patients. The front desk was helpful at the check in and with setting up next appointments,positive
"I love and trust my doctor (Dr. Sistrunk ) , and her staff.  The waiting room is clean and comfortable .  Also,  the front desk people gently guide you through check in process and how to check in for lab work.  The phobomists are very polite and have never needed to stick me more than once (I have small veins that move [as I have been told for years, as a regular red cross donor]).<br><br>In other words, great team!üëçüôÇ",positive
"MedStar is professional and attentive in helping us/you and me with our health issues. Best medical care in the country. You pick them, and you picked a good one.",positive
"I had my first appointment with Dr Bailey and was impressed.  She was thorough,  understanding, and so knowledgable.  It was my best experience going to the doctor - esp when trying to find a new doctor.",positive
"Doctor & assistant were thouough, and communicated well. An unexecuted referral was updated. Wait time was minimal for exam & Labcorp procedure.",positive
"Dr medley and the staff are fantastic!  Caring, take time to listen, thoughtful.    I‚Äôm so happy to go here",positive
"This place doesn't deserve any stars whatsoever. The front desk personnel are not only incompetent but also highly disrespectful, condescending, and racist. Their attitude is appalling and unacceptable. The wait time for blood work is absurdly long, even though it's just to get blood drawn and not to see a doctor. The level of disorganization and lack of efficiency is astonishing. If you value being treated with basic human decency and respect, steer clear of this place. It's an extremely frustrating and demeaning experience that no one should have to endure. Avoid this place at all costs if you don't want to be treated like dirt.<br><br>As for the Dr. who saw me, here is my letter to her:<br><br>Dear Dr. Sylvia R. Medley,<br><br>I am writing to express my deep disappointment and concern regarding the way you treated me during my recent visit to your clinic. Given your experience and age, it is truly disheartening to see such a lack of compassion and professionalism in your interactions with patients. It is not just your medical education that should guide you to be kind and considerate, but also your life experiences. Unfortunately, my experience with you has left me feeling that you are both heartless and rude.<br><br>During my visit, I felt completely unheard and disregarded. Despite my attempts to communicate my concerns, you essentially instructed me to wait and then never returned to the room. Instead, you sent another staff member who seemed completely unaware of my situation. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a busy clinic where you encounter numerous patients who rely on your care and expertise.<br><br>Given the severity of my experience, I strongly believe that someone with your approach should not be allowed to serve patients in such a high-volume environment. Patients deserve a doctor who listens, understands, and provides compassionate care.",negative
"My Wife had to go Urgent Care -Navy Yard, Wednesday, 02 October 2024, the receptionist Ariana Parker showed what customer service was all about! She greeted us, explained what my Wife had to fill out, was warm, pleasant, and friendly.  It wasn't just us she was that way with, while in waiting room , she displayed same pleasantries to 4 other patients that were there or came in, then when called back Nurse Angela was very pleasant as well, and when Dr Katherine came in and performed procedure on my Wife, Nurse Angela was very supportive and comforting to my Wife, Dr Katherine was great at finding out what( was going in, then explaining what she had to and was going to do, then did a phenomenal job during and after procedure.  I  know this is lengthy review but best experience with an emergency treatment, which is compliment to staff!!! Had to share positive experience, because in my opinion, people are quick about complaints and short on compliments. Again Great job, and mahalo üòáüå∫üå∑üåªüíúüíôüëåüèæ<br>Thomas J Blair Jr (Aundria)",positive
"Medstar Navy Yard Location....<br>What a difference two years makes‚Äîand not in a good way! Getting an appointment through MedStar in the DC area now takes 60 to 90 days, and after waiting over two months for my scheduled visit at MedStar Navy Yard, they called and canceled it. I called back expecting to be reasonably rescheduled‚Äîonly to be told the next available isn‚Äôt until **JULY**. Absolutely not acceptable. Whatever MedStar (Navy Yard) was doing two years ago, you seriously need to revisit it. This is beyond frustrating and completely unfair to patients trying to access care.<br><br>Check in was smooth. Wait time from check-in to vitals room less than 20 mins. Vitals to seeing the Dr. less than 15 mins.  Dr. Downing was amazing! Patient, attentive, knowledgeable, SUPER compassionate and kind. The staff was nice and efficient.",negative
I‚Äôve been to this location twice. Both experiences have been great. Very smooth check-in and reasonable waiting period for same day service.,positive
"Dr. Sunli Karla is an outstanding brilliant physician.<br><br>I am so grateful that I am onboard with him as my new primary care physician.<br><br>He's very thorough, and I feel comfortable with him.<br><br>The rest of the staff is great too.<br><br>Thank you for accepting me as a new patient!<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>John Duvall",positive
Dr Sistrunk is the best!  She listens and works with you to determine the best path forward.  Highly recommend her.,positive
"I prefer this MedStar Urgent Care. They are so kind from the front desk to the doctor & phlebotomist. Professional, swift service.",positive
"Dr Sistrunk is very professional, patience, caring and extremely excellent at her profession.",positive
"Could not recommend against this practice more strongly. Had a fairly serious health scare recently and my doctor made the process of obtaining necessary care and referrals to specialists incredibly challenging.<br><br>She also behaved as though submitting referrals to my insurance was an inconvenience and it took her over a month (and then, it was only after multiple calls and emails) to do so.",negative
"I have never been treated so rudely at a Dr.'s office. I was called at 7:30 am and rudely asked to change my appointment from 4:40 pm to 4 pm. Then I received another call at 9 am and again rudely asked why I wanted to see the Dr. The lady would not accept that it was the Dr who requested the appointment. The of course at 4 pm no one calls me and I don't have my appointment. I then receive several callas around 5 pm, which I imagine was the Dr, but of course I could not respond because I was at that moment driving and because I was already told my appointment was changed. Terrible experience and I still need to see a Dr.",negative
"Updated Review!<br>Please don‚Äôt see this lady Dr. Medley and this office!!!! Turns out the blood results that this ^ doctor failed to provide me support with was precancerous. AGAIN due to her lack of support and preventative medical care which this is the reason why we see a primary care doctor for preventative care, I had to meet with a new supportive doctor through GW Medical office and they supported me through my life-changing events. Plus the office doesn‚Äôt hold this behavior accountable, they just will give you a Chipotle gift card after your precancerous blood work is done with no follow up. Please I beg you people, DONT MEET WITH THIS DOCTOR.<br>Follow up-<br>I tried returning for my primary care annual appointment And things did not change. The first issue I had was my primary care doctor didn‚Äôt even know that I was scheduled for my annual appointment. I saw my doctor, but only 15 minutes altogether and wasn‚Äôt given the proper referrals for issue that I had. I tried to address another Concern Doctor Only to be told by the nurse That the doctor will not see you anymore because they were With another patient. This will be my last time With this office, which is sad I‚Äôve been attending here for 10 years.<br><br>Meet at your on risk, you will only be a number to check off a to-do list and not a individual. Lately it appears that I‚Äôm receiving healthcare by email from Dr. Medley. During my appointment on February 1, 2024, it felt like I was at a fast food restaurant only seeing her for 15 minutes for an annual visit. Now I need further support but her next follow up appointment is in April. I wish I had a PCP doctor that cared a little bit about me individually. At this time I choose to locate one. I hate to do this to another black woman, but I truly feel my health will decline under Dr. Medley‚Äôs care, she is too busy to notice me.<br><br>Honestly I believe the staff gave everyone a gift card for putting a Five Star review. This has not been my experience with Navy Yard Medstar. Although Dr. Medley is great the medical Front desk staff is the worst. They possess lack of professionalism and care for the client. It takes the staff forever to relay a message to the primary care doctor even respond back.<br>Also, when you arrive to the the customer service is very lackluster<br>The staff forgot to charge me my co-pay then sent my name to Collections",negative
"Professional ,efficient. and courteous! Kudos to Dr. Glaser, Megan, the Xray Technologist, and the Business Associates at the entrance and exit!",positive
"Dr. Medley is the best physician at this MedStar location. She listens, gives sound advice, and provides information on services available within the MedStar network. She has made all the difference in my healing journey.",positive
"The staff was helpful and pleasant, the wait was short, Dr Sistrunk was thorough and interested in me. Except for the  vaccines it was a nice experience.",positive
My doctor Medley was very unforgiving with the zooom technology because the internet was not unemdiately pick up the zoom link‚Ä¶ I felt insignificant.. and she wouldn‚Äôt reschedule si u could get to a better connection..,negative
The doctor I saw here had a mean demeanor. She actually put things in my record that I did not say. And she also accuse me of being irritated when I ask questions I would not recommend,negative
"My experience at MedStar was Very Pleasant. The guy that assisted me prior to seeing the Doc. was a Joy to work with, he was helpful, Caring & made me very comfortable. The Doc was very insightful & to the point which I appreciated. I felt good under his care.",positive
"Everything were great,  The people were very friendly  and very  helpful.  Everything  was explained to you.",positive
"The staff is amazing, had some shortens of breath issues going on and they were able to work me in for the next day appt. Dr. Rochon is amazing and I‚Äôm glad to be his patient.",positive
"The front desk has greatly improved, and customer service was both friendly and personal. I was very appreciative of the help I received from the staff.  I did not have to wait past my appointment to be seen.  The assistant to the doctor was friendly and helpful.  And the doctor was professional and listened to my questions and gave thoughtful answers.  All together, it was a very positive experience.",positive
"Dr, Sistrunk is Excellent!  Support staff not so.  Twice during the last year I was not notified of cancellations.",positive
"I just had my first appointment with Dr Medley and was so pleased to meet her and now have her in my court.  Dr. Medley showed interest in me and any medical issues or concerns that I had. She was very proactive in arranging diagnostic tests, efficient in having them carried out and responsive with test results, prescriptions and referrals.  Couldn‚Äôt ask for more.   And, she‚Äôs got a hearty laugh!",positive
Dr. Glacier was very thorough and put me at ease with his humor. The entire team made me feel seen.,positive
"Dr.Rochon and  nurse assistant  was very  thorough  and  explained  my concerns  very well,  the lab technician was also very   good  .",positive
"I'm so sad that my Dr. Sener Is leaving. She is Amazing and I will truly Miss her. She has taken such awesome care of me. It's like a child taking their first steps as a parent let's go of their hand . I wish her all the Blessings from Heaven. She has been my Dr., my friend. The building is amazing. There is little wait time , the staff is friendly,  professional and fun. They treat you with the utmost respect.  The exam rooms are fresh and clean always.",positive
"A good team!  It would be 5 stars, but 40 min late.  Clinically top notch, very thorough and a good listener (a reason for late).  This is a good city location.",positive
"Dr. Rochon is awesome, one of the few doctors I've met recently that takes the time to listen to everything you have to say and direct you to the proper resources. Both virtually and in person, you will feel that he takes your medical needs seriously. Highly recommend him!<br><br>I give 4 stars due to the intake process (which is more of a MedStar as a whole issue). I was asked for pictures of my insurance card multiple times and though the submission is always approved, the information is not updated in my chart, which leads to delays in billing. Hopefully that process can be smoother in the future for patients.",positive
"Dr. Bailey was so patient, thorough, and willing to listen to me! She gave me time at the end of my visit to ask any questions. Each and every staff member was so kind as well. I loved getting to chat with everyone, and I felt much more at ease than I expected to in a doctors office.",positive
"MedStar Health. My primary care doctor, Shryl Sistrunk is the best. The healthcare staff are very courteous and friendly. I go early and leave out early.",positive
"I had a pleasant experience at Medstar this week which began walking into the building. The security guard was so polite and helpful. She went to replenish the mask  container. She said, have a seat I will get it. The ladies behind the front desk were pleasant and seem to enjoy their job. The nurse who took my vitals was very nice, professional and pleasant. Dr.  Sistrunk listened to my concerns and took them into consideration. They couldn't draw my blood so I will visit another location.",positive
"Dr. Bailey (MedStar Team) seeks to provide quality health care. They search deeper to analyze data to better understand the individual needs. It is not a one size fits all approach. They take into account the intricacies of genetics, environment, and experience. The Team takes the health of a person seriously and aim to remedy problems or stave off potential health issues. It was an extensive doctor's visit but very much warranted. People generally do not look forward to doctor appointments. When you have an experienced team who cares about improving the health of the individual, it makes for a less daunting encounter... After a beloved doctor's departure, it is nice to be in good hands again.",positive
Dr Sistrunk is excellent.  She is a through professional that is always prepared and empathetic.  She has diagnosed several major health issues that saved my life.<br>I am truly grateful and appreciative of her expertise.,positive
I was seen in a timely manner. My doctor went over we my chart me and discussed why I was in today. We talked about my other doctors concerns. Ordered lab work and a done deal. So the doctor was great. Also the ladies up front were the best I was struggling with back pain to walk and one of the ladies in orthopedics saw me struggling and told the ladies in primary care that it looked like I might need some assistance. One of the ladies in primary came out with a wheelchair took me in and helped me register. I thought that was very kind of them. I worked at Georgetown for over 20ys and this is one of the best show of kindness and would like to thank the front ladies in orthopedics and primary care for  their kindness. Please tell them thanks for me.,positive
"Do not use this practice if you actually want to be seen by a provider. I have been a patient of Dr. Bailey's for years now, and still can't get an appointment. I began trying in October of 2023 when I needed a prescription refill, they said the first available with Dr. Bailey was December of 2023, so I took the appointment. Then the day of the appointment it was ""bumped"". Then this happened again when I was rescheduled for both March and June. Because you can't get an appointment that is less than 2-3 months away from when you call. They also show very little sympathy when you've been ""bumped"".",negative
Was seen promptly. Absolutely love that Dr. Rochon listens and does not make his patients feel that he has to rush to the next person. Very pleased with Dr. Rochon and the entire staff at Navy Yard.,positive
"Arrived early for my 8:30 AM appt for lab tests to accompany my annual physical and was told to sit in waiting area after signing in.  Many patients came and went following my arrival, so after waiting 30 minutes I asked when I would be seen and was ignored by the  front desk clerk. 15 minutes later I was finally called by the lab tech, at which time I was informed that my Dr. had not issued a proper order and was not available for confirmation's so I could not get the tests performed as scheduled! I wasted over 90 minutes on a morning which I had no time to spare and was denied service because my Dr. didn‚Äôt submit his order for tests he wanted done and was duly scheduled as ordered. Incompetence!",negative
I was very happy with my visit today at MedStar Health. Dr. Downing could not have been kinder. She spent a lot of time trying to get to know me and my health issues as I am a new patient. Her support staff was also very nice and the facility was clean and comfortable. I recommend this practice without hesitation.<br>I‚Äôm sorry to have to change this review but I waited to see Dr. Downing so that I would have a doctor who knows me. I am now sick at the beginning of January and she can‚Äôt see me until February. That makes no sense at all! I am able to be seen by another Dr in the practice but that is not at all the kind of care I was looking for.,positive
"Dr. Kalra is an ace; kind, considerate, and intelligent. He's got me for live, which,, as I am 88, is only a mild threat.",positive
"From reception to medical care, my experience with Medstar has been great.",positive
Staffs were friendly and I didn‚Äôt wait long to get the labs and see the doctor,positive
"Dr. Robinson took excellent care of my husband Todd Williams when he had a medical crisis earlier this year. He is attentive professional, and thorough. We both appreciate his care and treatment protocols.",positive
"I had a great experience at MedStar Med Group at Navy Yard. I am a new patient and left feeling great. From the time I walked in until I left. The staff at the front desk was kind, patient and greeted me (everyone) with a smile and kind spirit. They checked me out with the same smiles and kindness. I saw them handle elderly clients with such care & support.  The medical team - from nurses to techs to the doctors - were all professional, timely and had great customer service. Dr. Downing is AMAZING and her nurse Tameka was great too. They both took such care and time with me. I didn‚Äôt feel rushed and I didn‚Äôt feel forgotten. Kudos to the entire team. I hope that whatever they are doing to ensure strong professional service continues. Thank you for all you do and providing such a great first experience.",positive
"1) Lack of responsibility<br>2) Disrespect for past commitment<br>3) Insensitivity to the situation<br>4) Focusing only on doctors and neglecting patient care.<br><br>I scheduled an annual physical check-up appointment at this center. First, I called and made the appointment, and then I completed all the necessary paperwork online. Finally, everything was confirmed one month ago. However, just today, a few days before the scheduled appointment, I received a message stating, 'We regret to inform you that your appointment with Dr. Medley on 12/26/2023 needs to be rescheduled.' Oh my god, my carefully planned holiday schedules and travel plans for this appointment are now completely disrupted. I called the center to inquire about how this happened, but the call center informed me that Dr. Medley is responsible and they are unable to assist.",negative
"This place is disorganized, hard to get in with, and generally disappointing. Doctors complain about being understaffed and under-supported by higher ups. This is not my problem as the patient.<br><br>I had sent 5 messages on the portal and called 3 times to get a pre-op physical for cancer surgery. It‚Äôs ridiculous that I had to do that.

Community manager has asked me to fill out a survey below but no call regarding my actual health or results which could be abnormal<br><br>Still waiting to hear from Dr. Sistrunk about my lab results. I guess I will be waiting forever because Scheduler says I need to arrange a telemedicine appointment to go over results.

Scheduler also asked me if anything was abnormal on my results like I have the medical degree to interpret lab results. I had to call them.<br><br>Also, Dr. Sistrunk rushed my appointment as a new patient and didn‚Äôt give the proper attention because she was too worried about getting to the next one.<br><br>Overall, poor service.

Additionally, the front desk staff as well as the medical assistant were all friendly, patient, and professional. I am thoroughly pleased with my experience and have already shared her information with a few family and friends.",positive
"I had high hopes after such a wonderful experience for my initial appointment. The wait was short and the nurse who took my vitals was amazing and super nice- I wish I remembered her name because she deserves a shoutout and a raise. The doctor I saw was nice, but didn‚Äôt seem particularly knowledgeable about a prescription I have been prescribed for over a decade, and kept insisting only a psychiatrist could provide me this prescription. I thought that to be offensive because I‚Äôve always had my primary care doctor prescribe me this prescription, and have never been told to see a psychiatrist for this script. However she agreed to write me a refill. Unfortunately she called in the wrong prescription, and despite calling the office everyday for a week I have not received a single update. I was told on Monday this would be remedied within 48 hours. It is now 5 days later. I sent a message yeaterday through the portal to the Dr. asking if she had called the pharmacy to correct the prescription. The response I received back was so insulting. She responded with a list of 10+ psychiatrists with 0 context and no answer to my question. I am feeling really cast aside by the healthcare system and really confused over this. It feels like my medication is being held hostage. If they are busy- just communicate it- don‚Äôt leave patients in the dark wondering when or IF they will ever get their prescription.",negative
"This is the first Google review I have ever left, so clearly am passionate about how terrible my experience was here and want to help others know before they visit. I had the worst possible physicians yearly visit experience here! I waited for maybe 45 minutes to an hour to even see the doctor and apparently asking a few questions about my health meant that I got billed an additional $230 (in addition to the regular checkup fee that my insurance covers) because it was outside the standard visit that only covers heart rate and blood pressure? I promise you this was not an extensive visit, I doubt I was seen for more then fifteen minutes. There is no cost transparency, long wait times, poor service - do not go here! I for one will surely will never return to MedStar",negative
"5 stars for the front desk staff, and lab techs. Dr.Sistrunk was horrible. She doesn‚Äôt care about your reason for the visit.

She listened to me, is funny, real, and incredibly personable all while being knowledgable, helpful, and addressed several concerns with a comprehensive plan. The nurse I had was great too. I had zero wait time and found the front desk staff awesome as well. I‚Äôm so glad I switched to Medstar.",positive
5/2 was my second time (and 8/26 was my third) having to reschedule my virtual follow-up appointment because the Dr was a no show after I waited over an hour in the virtual waiting room.

My experience with my visits to Medstar has been consistent. Dr.Systrunk is an amazing doctor who cares about her patients. She is always on time and listens to her patients. I know this to be a fact as I have referred many of my friends/colleagues to her for treatment. They all have shared the same sentiments as I.,positive

"Horrible experience. After I spent three hours on the phone with medical associates to find an appointment and after they ASSURED me they had CONFIRMED this doctor and location accepted my insurance, I go the appointment, check in and am put in an examination room, only to be told the doctor will NOT treat me because they don‚Äôt my insurance! Then the manager tried to gaslight and blame me! Tried to fob me off to go to urgent care. They don‚Äôt do examinations and lab work and had already refused to help three weeks prior! They were the ones who made a referral for a primary care! And to make it worse that manager asked to see my insurance card and claimed my primary was the MD listed when THAT doctor was a) in a different medical group b) didn‚Äôt practice the specialty I was there to be treated for in the first place! Gynecologist and Internists are NOT the same. MedStar is TRASH!!!!",negative

"Of all the MedStar clinics, this one is the most organized and caring of patients - a huge part of that thanks to admin staff like Antoinette, who go out of their way to check in patients, keep the office moving, and going above and beyond to get them referrals and keep tabs on the doctors. Every time I‚Äôm in there she is helpful - and Dr Bailey is attentive and empathetic, gives referrals and meds timely, and the office is on schedule. They‚Äôve made exceptions and seen me last minute many times. Thank you Dr Bailey, Antoinette, and team!",positive
"Seeing the reviews made me a little nervous, but I went to MedStar Navy Yard based on a friend's recommendation, and I'm SO glad that I did. I had an appointment with Dr. Bailey, but she was running 40-60 minutes behind, so the receptionist was able to switch me to see another doctor in the practice, Dr. Downing. I was called back in less than 10 minutes past my appointment time, and both the nurse who did my initial intake and Dr. Downing couldn't have been more kind. Dr. Downing listened so well to my concerns and was eager to find a solution with me. The women at the front desk couldn't have been nicer to me, and overall my experience at this location was wonderful!",positive
"Dr Leuschen is everything one could wish for in a doctor: compassionate, caring, and a consummate professional.

"2 stars only for my physician visit, he deserves 5 stars. However, the staff working at this location unfortunately ruined the experience for me. Every single person was rude and acted as if they were annoyed that patients were in the office. I watched as they cut patients off mid-sentence, roll their eyes and respond with a short tone. I was not the only patient who felt the attitude that day. I hate to say it, but I would avoid this place. They also never answer the phone.",negative
"Terrible experience.<br><br>My annual physical is covered by insurance, so I called in January 2023 to schedule an appointment. They were available only two months out, not great but I schedule an appointment. Just before the appointment, they cancel and say they can‚Äôt reschedule me for another two months. I get the physical done around May and they take blood for labs.  Afterwards, LabCorp‚Äôs hits me with bills for my covered, annual physical labs. After many phone calls with insurance, LabCorp, and MedStar (all of whom of course say, ‚Äútalk to the others‚Äù) I finally get it addressed with MedStar resubmitting the correct codes. Then MedStar hits me with a $126 bill for the 15 min phone call to go over my labs. More calls with Insurance and MedStar, both say that the doctor‚Äôs office visit was covered by insurance and the labs were covered by insurance, but the 15 min phone conversation to go over the labs was not covered.<br><br>After waiting months, last min cancellation and reschedule for months out, then managing all the billing errors and issues, and then to have a $126 bill just to get my lab results, it was all too much.",negative

From the moment I walked into their office, every staff member was not only extremely informative but kind as well. Kim, Dr. Medley‚Äôs assistant, was so warm and made me feel instantly at ease.  Kim took her time to get to know me as an individual rather than just another patient.  Dr. Medley was supremely diligent and thorough with her examination and care.

Dr. Billie Downing is one of the BEST doctors in the DMV area!!! Her bedside manner is impeccable. She explains everything of your diagnosis and the next steps as if you are a part of her immediate family.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Dr. Sistrunk was patient and gave me a thorough examination. She asked lots of questions and gave me the opportunity to do so as well.

"Ugh. I wasn‚Äôt pleased and I‚Äôve love Medstar, both my Mom (who this is for) and I are with the practice. However after 8 months of rescheduled appointments, as a new patient, with Dr Sistrunk she immediately informed us she was no longer taking new patients. We could‚Äôve been informed about this without having to schedule an appointment with the Dr (two of which she previously rescheduled, this was a new patient appointment). I chose her for my mom because of her rating experience and speciality with dementia. She did an evaluation of my mom at the appointment, wasn‚Äôt interested in much else we had to say. She spoke incredibly fast and impatiently, cut me off a few times. At the end although she did then ask if I had any questions, at that point I was glad she won‚Äôt be my moms Dr but it was a very disappointing appointment.<br><br>The intake staff were great though, and another Dr in the same office, Dr Rochon, he listens and is patient, but doesn‚Äôt specialize in dementia. The office is slow to respond via patient portal, have to call. We may choose Dr Rochon as primary care, but after this 8 month wait for Dr Sistrunk for a rushed appointment, I‚Äôm pretty disgusted!",negative

"My initial review was 5 stars, then 3 stars, and now 1 star. If I could give 0 stars I would. I first used Dr. Medley with MedStar in Eastern Market (never had problems at that location) and was thrilled with the move to Navy Yard since I live so close by. However, their service has swiftly gone downhill.<br><br>The doctors and nurses are great - I always get good care and I have always been thoroughly pleased with their performance. What makes this location horrendous is the front desk staff, phone staff, and admin staff. Either they don‚Äôt care or they are terrible at their job. Here‚Äôs a list of the reasons why I‚Äôm no longer going to use them anymore.<br><br>1. Even when their is nobody in the waiting room, I‚Äôm forced to wait 20-30+ minutes for a pre-scheduled appointment.<br><br>2. While they have zero problem making patients wait 20-30+ minutes when their is no wait, they won‚Äôt extend the same courtesy when you‚Äôre 15-30 minutes late to an appointment and will force you to reschedule.<br><br>3. I‚Äôm always forced to fill out admin documents which I‚Äôve already been prompted to fill out online and have already completed.<br><br>4. I have reached out with health questions on the online portal and have on occasion received no response or an extraordinarily delayed response.<br><br>5. The worst of all - it‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE to get through the phone lines. It rings and rings for eternity or goes to voicemail making it impossible talk to a human when necessary. For example, I got into a bad scooter accident over Thanksgiving which resulted in a concussion and broken nose.<br><br>The ER doctor gave me explicit instructions to schedule a PCP follow up in three days. I called in and could never get through. So, I walked in to schedule an appointment and they wouldn‚Äôt schedule me for another week despite the severity of the injury resulting in delayed care.<br><br>6. They have no professionalism. I once went in for an annual and when I left the discharge papers given to me were for another patient which had personal information on it. A clear HIPPA violation. When they called me today to reschedule my annual physical they asked me if I was a new patient - I‚Äôve been a patient for five years. More importantly, they were asking to reschedule an appointment time they offered and booked me on their own. The replacement time was for over one month out.",negative
"Dr Melis Sener is the epitome of  professional physicians in her diagnostic skills.  And she cares about her patients,!

"Dr. Bailey is hands down 5 stars - she listens and understands and seems up with the times on the best care for her patients. However, there is not adequate support. Some of the nurses / office staff are pleasant, but others are rude (you can tell they do not want to be there or help you). Medstar has a great online portal to communicate with the Dr., but even when Dr. Bailey asks the nurse/office staff to respond... still nothing.  It's hard to schedule appointments over phone, and when you do get one, there could be an extremely long wait to be seen (I waited over 2+ hours my first visit). I am really conflicted on continuing to visit this location. If I were starting fresh, I'd find a different location.<br><br>I will update the review if (fingers crossed) things change. Hoping for the best.",negative

On two occasions I had trouble getting my elderly mother's preop forms routed to her primary care doctor and then faxed to her orthopedist and Vivienne saved the day each time. She is very effective at her job and made sure that in each case the forms got where they were supposed to and followed up with a confirmation call in each instance! Thank You, Vivienne and I hope this message finds it way to you and you boss!",positive
"I'm never one to write public reviews, but the situation with this practice has become untenable. Dr. Rochon is amazing - easily 5 stars, one of the best doctors I've ever had - but the support staff are making me consider leaving the practice. I feel lucky if someone picks up the phone in under 20 minutes.<br><br>Then there's the incompetence. Just today, I had to have a follow up appointment with Dr. Rochon; the staff booked me with the wrong doctor, mixed up what phone number to call, and wasted more than an hour of a very busy work day. Given how long the wait times are for a phone call to be picked up, there was no way to rectify the issue. An hour past appointment time I'm still waiting to talk to the doctor.<br><br>Either the practice has to fix itself, or they may be losing another patient.",negative
"Simply shocking, persistent incompetence. They screwed up my insurance information, so the blood work lab is sending me erroneous bills, and they‚Äôve told me I have to fix their mistake. Then they forgot to send me the results of the blood work. They asked me to come in to discuss the results, then changed an in person visit to a virtual appointment without telling me. They then sent me a link for the appointment that didn‚Äôt work. They then made me wait around 40min to get another link. Unbelievable waste of time. I can‚Äôt imagine what else they would screw up. Highly recommend going anywhere else.",negative
I have called this office 7 times today and waited for minimum of 20 minutes each time waiting to helped but the front desk staff to schedule an appointment to be cleared for surgery. I have called them intermittently over the past two weeks and still don‚Äôt have an appointment because no one answers the phone. I absolutely love my new PCP but this lack of care from staff to simply answer my call will lead me to find another health care provider. At this rate I‚Äôll have to go in person to schedule an appointment because it has to be done within the next two weeks. Please do better so I can keep my doctor.,negative

Outstanding! My doctor at MedStar is Dr Kalra he is my primary care physician.Very professional and takes out the time to explain all of my test results. Asking if I have any questions.

"This 5 star is for Dr. Rochon specifically.  He‚Äôs my primary care physician and he‚Äôs the best PCP I‚Äôve ever had.  Why?

He‚Äôs kind and patient, the type of doctor I trust.",positive
"Like many others who have written reviews, good service and terrible billing. They made sure to charge me outside of my primary care yearly visit and did it in a really sneaky way.

We'll see, but I already called their customer care and they refused to budge on the extra surprise charge of over 200 dollars....",negative
"My doctor is amazing, but the receptionists and front desk employees are oftentimes disourteous and downright rude. Phone calls are left unreturned. Its really hard to get an appointment scheduled- no one hardly ever answers the phone. I've had a desk worker hang the phone up on me for no reason. Customer service training on how to talk to patients would be highly recommended. Although I like my doctor, I'm seriously considering finding another one based solely on my customer service experience with the front desk. If you're considering this office, be warned.",negative
Dr. Medley is such a fantastic and caring physician. She always takes the time to answer my questions and does a good job promoting healthy lifestyle. She figured out that I had a vitamin D3 deficiency by a cluster of vague symptoms and even texted me the day after my blood work to make sure I got the right supplement. I cannot recommend her highly enough.,positive
"Arrived after 5:00 pm at the Navy Yard MedStar facility, requesting last minute blood analysis lab (TB negative blood draw) for a new employment opportunity.

My doctor failed to provide basic testing for cancer. I had to request the test during my physical. I'm a new patient with this practice. Ultimately after getting the test. I had to get an MRI and I do have cancer. My wife said if you hadn't  requested the test. You would have gone another year or 6months without a diagnosis. Furthermore they prescribed the wrong blood pressure medication. The staff went back and forth that I said this particular medication.  But told them to read MyChart and it was in there. I'm thinking about changing primary care group,negative
"Great service! Timely, professional, knowledgeable staff and the facility is always clean.",positive
"I recently had a virtual visit with Dr. Medley, this was my first visit and I am very pleased with the care I received. She listened to me, asked relevant questions about what I am experiencing, and provided advice on what I could do to improve my overall health. If you are looking for a physician, I would definitely recommend reaching out to her at MedStar Navy Yard.",positive
"Excellent experience, with friendly and professional staffers, an impressive primary care physician, and, to my happy surprise, no waiting.  As a new arrival in the area, I was concerned it would be challenging to find a primary care physician who fit my needs.  I lucked out with my choice.  Dr. Rochon's friendly staff very thouroughly worked me through my medical history, while Dr. Rochon himself spent an unusually long time discussing my background and health issues, examining me, and providing me contact information for specialists in areas of relevance to my situation.  He is relaxed in manner, a good listener, and unrushed.  Plus he has a sense of humor, not always the case with physicians as they hurry through their day.",positive
"I am incredibly surprised by the number of positive reviews. Let me share with you my experience.<br><br>In October I required a refill for blood pressure medicationn. I called Medstar for a new prescription and they mentioned I needed to see the doctor in order to get a new prescription. That has never happened with previous physicians for this medication. It was a problem because my next appointment with Dr. Emile Rochon was a month away. I asked that they contact Dr. Rochon to see if he could provide a new prescription before our next appointmentt. There was no return phone call and I followed up twice after that call. I ended up running out of blood pressure medication for a whole month prior to our appointment.<br><br>Just recently, I called Medstar three times for a doctor referral. And there has been no follow-up again and we're going on week two...<br><br>Highly recommend training is conducted for all members to follow-up with patient inquiries. Or that more staff is hired to deal with the volume of requests",negative
"The staff are as helpful as they can be but it seems there's a lot of non-communication and lost notes here. Call back often to follow up, you may need to make the same request several times and to several different people before they mobilize on it.<br><br>If your visit is entirely routine it will probably go smoothly... Otherwise, good luck",positive
"Do not schedule a test result follow up as the standard practice just because it is billable.<br>Test results can be handled with the on line app.  If there is need for follow up, then a call can be made or an email sent.  Providing a follow up virtual visit as a routine recommendation is unnecessary and patients ought to be told that the virtual visit is optional and only recommend when the results indicate the necessity for the virtual visit.",positive
"Dr. Rochon and the staff were great as always. Great bedside manner and efficient, they even saw me early, unheard of for today‚Äôs medical community. Highly recommend.",positive
Dr Kalra is and alwsys available to help.  His nurses were AWESOME.  I had a brief fainting episode and they jumped in and knew what to do and got me the care I needed.   They were superstars.,positive
"My visit with Dr. Sistrunk was very productive. My appointment was at 8:00 and the nurse came out to get me a few minutes before 8:00 a.m.  Dr. Sistrunk and her nurse are very warm and kind.  They are both very professional and efficient.  They both listened and responded attentively to my concerns. When calling the office, after listening to the recording, I am put on hold for a long time, 15 - 30 minutes.  The parking is a little inconvenient.  I don't like elevators, but I will adjust once some of the construction is finished and I can find parking on the streets.  Overall I a very pleased with my visits.",positive
"My Dr. is good, and the staff are great, but I get a ""surprise"" medical bill every time I go for bogus charges of events that never happened. Basically seeing a Dr. here means fighting with their billing department for the next few months to correct statements.",negative
"Tomeka, Sky, and Vivienne went above and beyond getting me in last minute to see the doctor. Their kindness and creativity spoke volumes about the office and its consideration of patients. I am so grateful!",positive
"Excellent service.  Excellent care.  Everyone from the Front Desk Attendants to the Physicians are friendly, caring, and kind.  By far, this is the best primary care practice that I have experienced.   The wait time‚Ä¶there is none.",positive
Accommodating my appointment even while I sick! Thanks Medstar,positive
"I have been a patient at this facility for many years since the 90s. and although my primary care physicians have changed multiple times, I still stayed with the doctor that took over for each of my former primary care physicians. A lot of the staff still remain the same and even the new staff fits right in with pure kindness. Hi even switched health insurances so I can remain under the same care",positive
A wonderful friend recommend Dr. Gerard Harris and was so excited to see if he was taking new patients when I called 6 different times to have no one answer the phone. Called this morning for one last attempt being a glutton for punishment to be told at 8:15am to call back during office hours between 8am and 5pm. Sad...hope the physicians realize how many patients they are losing for having poor administration of their offices.,negative
"I really like this location and the employees here. Note that parking can be tricky in the area, so public transportation may be a better option. On my most recent visit I scanned a QR code upon arrival to complete the check in, then was called to the front desk to fill out a COVID-19 screening questionnaire. Wait times absolutely do vary but the waiting room is spacious with large windows, a tv, and a water station. Your experience may also vary by provider but I've always been satisfied with my visits.",positive
"was great. efficient front desk, orderly sign ins, doctor visit, and results. the online stuff works well for me - i hope it supports those that use it less (but those won't be folks evaluting these reviews as much... :) Still great care and fast - even did the multiple follow ups with my pharmacy who kept saying they didn't receive the order!!!)",positive
"As others have said, great doctors but subpar service. Curious how the management continues to acknowledge these reviews but it seems as if the level of service hasn't improved. Where do I start...<br><br>1) Person over phone who I made appointment with told me a different address/Medstar location. My email confirmation had the Navy Yard address. Had to call and confirm Navy Yard was indeed accurate.<br>2) Showed up 20 minutes early as directed only to find a sign saying they are having a meeting and won't be open until later.<br>3) Someone let us in eventually and then did not give clear direction to people to check in... just told us to sit down. This resulted in confusion and frustration when she then just shouted ""next"" and people who were here after us walked up to check in.<br>4) Overheard both receptionists unprofessionally arguing with each other of whether or not they should have let us in, they are missing their meeting, etc.",negative
My experience with the med star physician went very well. Important information was shared and provided for future visits.,positive
Dr. Sistrunk was prepared for my visit as she had reviewed all reports of other specialists that I see.  She listened to my concerns and offered suggestions for me to follow.  She showed an interest in my health and a dedication to helping me conquer my challenges.  She‚Äôs an excellent doctor.,positive
Wow. After calling to set up an appointment as a new patient and being on hold for over 30 minutes each time I finally got someone but she was rude. She cut me off before I could even tell her why I was calling and then continued to put me on hold 3 times before I could finally get any information on availability. She tried to collect all my insurance details despite me telling her no I just need to check availability. Then she threw me on hold a 4th time for an unknown reason. Absolutely terrible service and that's even before ever going in.,negative
Absolutely love the services provided here. Warm and friendly staff! Im so glad to be apart of the family now. Dr. Sistrunk is the absolute BEST and her assistant!!!,positive
Dr.Sistrunk and her staff are extremely professional,positive
"I will agree with other reviewers that it was initially difficult to get through to this office by phone to make an appointment (took a few tries). But my appointment itself was thorough, efficient and on a Saturday so it was extremely convenient. The office was clean, updated and has a lab onsite for bloodwork. Dr. Medley is great and the staff was professional. Plus, once you establish care, you can schedule future appointments, see test results and message your doctor directly through the medstar portal without having to call the office.",positive
It‚Äôs always a pleasure and we love Dr. Leuschen we saw her up in the VA office and she moved down to DC navy yard and we followed as well.,positive
"I was referred to MedStar Orthopedics from Urgent Care and called today to make an appointment.  While I was on hold I decided to look up the practice's reviews and saw some of these poor reviews.  While still on hold, I looked up Washingtonian's list of the city's best doctors, found a different practice, verified that it was in-network, called another practice using a second phone, and got fully booked all while waiting on hold with MedStar.  While I can't rate the services provided by this establishment, I can say that it's remarkably difficult to get service which is how I based my rating.",negative
"Wait times are ridiculous.  Last ""appointment"" I had, I waited a half hour to be shown to an examining room, and then waited another half hour in the examining room for the physician to appear.  I have had difficulty reaching the front desk.  You don't receive call backs when you leave messages.  And, getting prescriptions refilled often involves multiple calls.  In short, the office is a mess.  The doctors are competent and the location is convenient.  Other than that, there is nothing to recommend it.",negative
"Dr. Sener is one of the best doctors I‚Äôve ever had.  She‚Äôs patient, thorough and friendly.  She leaves no stone unturned. I am a highly satisfied patient with full confidence in her medical advice and decisions.",positive
"Utter lack of transparency comprise the 4 missing stars. I went last year for my first physical, had to go twice because the instructions lacked any explanation on preparation for labs. The third meeting for results had to happen, but was uninformed that it was an additional cost. The clinic couldn‚Äôt give me any clear prices when asked before hand, and did not clearly delineate when something was part of the check up and when it wasn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm not a fan of these medical clinics charging whatever they want and not giving you the option to opt out. Had I known, I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything or scheduled that last one (were that even an option). [edited for grammar]",negative
"Just don't bother. If you do manage to make an appointment, it will most likely be incorrect (like my last 3 appointments) or you will just be left in the lobby while everyone is more concerned with lunch rather than helping patients. The sad part is, I really like my doctor, but it's not worth the incompetent front desk.",negative
"An apptmt was made for me w/out my consent. I texted the office and the portal that the day/time did not work for me and they called w/ E apptmt anyway. Again, I said I was NOT available.I had an MRI and was told Dr. would be in touch w/in 24 to 48 hours. I called four times and almost three weeks later finally received my results. The excuse is the DR has too many offices. Not acceptable. If you can't manage three practices then reduce your offices.",negative
"Dr. Sylvia Medley is the best. Always listening to understand and responding with empathy, care and adept knowledge. I always feel well taken care of and confident in her medical and people skills.",positive
"What a great experience - friendly staff, efficient processes and I didn‚Äôt have a long wait! Most important, I felt the doctor heard and addressed my concerns. I‚Äôm so happy I chose MedStar Navy Yard!",positive
Front desk was very professional and efficient.  Everything went like clockwork. Little or no wait time,positive
"I had an appointment with Dr Emile Rochon, at the Navy Yard Primary Medical practice, at 915 Half St SE, in Washington DC office.  And he attended to all my medical needs professionally with the quickest response also I highly recommend him 100% percent to everyone, because he had demonstrated to both my self and mother with the best Doctors care  bedside minors as well.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Dkj",positive
Tasleem was great for my X-Ray. Thank you!,positive
"I love this office. Efficient, pleasant experience every time I go. I love Dr. Medley. She is an excellent doctor and her staff is professional and courteous.",positive
"I would just like to say I was very impressed by Khadija Bowen the Senior Practice Manager. Very kind, patient, and went above and beyond to meet my needs when I was in a bind. A+!!",positive
"Great overall experience. Check in was easy, appointment started on time. Dr. Medley is amazing! Easy to talk to, friendly and takes your concerns seriously!",positive
"Great experience.  Check-in process was simple, wait time was short, nurses and assistants were helpful and friendly.  Dr. Kalra was very patient, listening to all of my concerns and answering my questions.",positive
"If I could give 0 Stars, I would. This place is horrendous on all counts. If you have any sense take yourself to an E.R. or minute clinic. Upon arrival the check in is simple enough but the entire place is understaffed and the staff they do host are rude. Further, if you see a wait time of an hour, tack on two more for good measure. Even if you look to the Queue which indicates your place in line, its usefulness is laughable.  After waiting four hours I decided to leave but not before trying to get my money back. Suffice it to say that caused their heads to spin as they began arguing the point that they ""generally"" don't do that kind of thing. Luckily I was given my money back. Moral of the story, this place is awful. Do not--I repeat--do not go.",negative
"Dr. Sener was prompt, courteous, and of course, correct with her assessment. I have been driving all the way from Manassas, VA just to see her.  All of the supporting I staff was excellent as well. I would highly recommend!",positive
"Had an appointment with Dr. Sapp. It went well and they were supposed to follow up the following day for xray results, that was a week ago today. Extremely unprofessional and everytime I call I get referred to a phone number that's not monitored",negative
"Dr. Sylvia Medley and the entire staff here are incredible! I have been a patient for a few years now and I appreciate the quality of service offered and Dr. Medley‚Äôs professionalism, knowledge and care-I found the best doctor!",positive
"Medstar health is always efficient with their process and procedures. The staff is great, and my doctor always pay attention to listen to my needs. I always get the best care when I go for my appointment.",positive
"Dr. Sunil Kalra is one of the best physicians in the DMV area. The Nurses and Administrators are kind, caring and helpful. The Med Star Navy Yard team is always on point!",positive
Went for a general checkup as a new patient.  I just answered the doctor questions and was not about to ask questions or share concerns related to my health.  was told to book another appointment for my questions.   This practice prioritize making money over patient health.,negative
"Unprofessional front desk and nurse team, doctor was not much better.<br><br>I arrived 20 minutes early as instructed and ended up waiting an hour past my appointment time before anyone even took me back to an exam room. The nurse who saw me was coughing the entire time. I told her multiple times that I was there for the varicella vaccine, and when it came time to administer it, she asked me if I ""wanted Pfizer."" She was about to give me a COVID-19 vaccine instead of the varicella vaccine that I was there for. The real kicker though is that during check-out, she printed out and handed me someone else's medical records and then promptly left, so I was standing there holding another patient's confidential records.",negative
The wait time is never too long at this particular location.,positive
It is completely unacceptable and unsatisfactory to have an appointment with Dr. Bailey and have to sit for 3 hours while she takes breaks.  It is more embarrassing for the staff to discuss it while patients are upset. Think twice before considering an appointment.  Medstar please do better.,negative
MedStar worked me in to their schedule the very day I spoke with them.  The doctor and staff were very professional and pleasant.,positive
"When one cannot complete one's bloodwork, which is part of the regular checkup, because of the front desk staff and their rudeness and their unprofessionalism is telling of the lack of care from the healthcare industry. Moreover, the front desk staff, at the new MedStar Navy Yard location, and their cruel behavior dates back to that same intimidating staff when they were at Eastern Market. So, nothing is going to change, which is upsetting because the doctors at this location are wonderful!<br><br>Is Kenneth A. Samet aware of these bad reviews regarding this particular location and its front desk staff?",negative
"No response from the on-call doctor. Called at 11:52pm and after giving the operator all my information, I was instructed to call back after 30 minutes if I didn‚Äôt receive a call. No return call so I called again at 12:30am. Had to take all my information again and given the same instruction. No return call so I called for a 3rd time at 1:06am and the operator began asking for all my information for a third time. I asked if he could just escalate my two previous requests and he said no. I‚Äôm tired and in pain, not waiting around for another 30 minutes only to not receive a callback. Do better, MedStar.",negative
Short wait time to be seen by the doctor. Dr. Sener went over my tests individually and explained everything thoroughly. She showed genuine concern for my issues.,positive
"I just called to follow up on a telehealth visit that I had in December (2 months ago) because I never heard back from the doctor about next steps. I was told that there was no information in the system about my visit with the doctor. This explains the no referral, dx, or any follow up. The strange thing is that I have a Rx that the doctor wrote at that visit that has been filled and refilled.  So now I have to start over and find another doctor for the same unresolved problem. Obviously, I would not recommend this practice.",negative
"So many reasons to avoid this place. A couple of the big ones - doctors here won‚Äôt actually do anything for you. They refer you to other doctors in the medstar system, even if those doctors aren‚Äôt accepting new patients. Another reason this place is awful - even trying to do something as simple as getting a sti panel takes hours, they make you make two separate appointments just to get lab tests. Urgent care facilities run by other hospitals in the area are much easier to deal with.",negative
"ATTITUDE PROBLEMS!!!!!  I just called to schedule an appointment and the person that answered had an attitude.  This is is not the first time this has happened.  Also, getting a call back to get results from a physical exam even though I called numerous times.  They kept saying Tasha would call me back with the results.  I like Dr. Rashan but I will go elsewhere.",negative
My doctor Dr Mullner is an amazing doc who I would give 5 stars to. This one star review is for MedStar and specific to this location. Why a MedStar would choose a location with absolutely no parking makes no sense and especially when street parking is non-existent And no public garages. Spent 35 minutes trying to find a space which I did....12 blocks away. Additionally you cannot reach anyone by phone at this location to inquire with them about the possibility of parking. Best advice I can give anyone is to not book to come here. You‚Äôll get frustrated with just trying to find parking. Just go elsewhere.,negative
"While I was out today, I received a missed phone call from Dr. Kalra, my primary care physician.  I made 4 attempts to return the call.  All attempts went unanswered.  Finally called the Patients' Care Office at Medstar Washington Hospital Center to find out what why the phones were not being answered.  The staff member said she would try calling.  She finally called back to say they were not answering her calls either!!  She called in on the physicians' line and they finally answered and promised her they would call me.  They did NOT call.  This office is nearly impossible to call.  If there was another medical provider in our area, I'd NEVER go to these drs",negative
"This MedStar health primary care is good area near my home. Inside office, I wish as electric appointment through video should provide interpreters and it is ADA law.  sometime I can't come in person, it save my time communities from my work in MD to DC.",positive
The staff was very professional and helpful. My doctor took adequate time with me and answered all of my questions. She was very professional and caring.,positive
"Even if you have an appointment confirmation, they may decide not to see you. They said it wasn't an official appointment even though I made it through their website and received texts (see picture). The staff wasn't helpful and refused to work with me for a simple TB test.",negative
"I‚Äôve tried sending in two online requests for appointments that they *say* will be answered in one business day. I know it‚Äôs COVID, but it‚Äôs been 3+ weeks since the first one. Tried to call to make an appointment today, was on hold for 20 minutes. I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere if this is the service they‚Äôre providing prospective patients.",negative
Dr. Sener is very nice. Listens carefully and takes her time. She doesn't force her opinions on you but lets you decide the level of medical intervention you want.,positive
Really conflicted as well‚Ä¶I give Dr. Medley 5 stars‚Ä¶but I can‚Äôt get anyone to answer the phone so I can make an appointment‚Ä¶I‚Äôve called 4 times today and had to wait a minimum of 20min+ and still no one answers. I‚Äôve called other days as well and could get anyone to answer. I‚Äôve tried to book an appointment online but late November is the earliest appointment I could find. Would be helpful to be able to talk to an office administrator to resolve simply booking an appointment.,negative
Clinicians were knowledgeable & took their time. This was my first visit & that was very important to me.,positive
"Hello, To whom it may concern.  I'm writing  to inform Tomeka, supervisor.  Every time I come to the office . she go beyond  to make sure I get the correct  help. She's  the best . Thanks.",positive
Staff friendly and professional.<br>Facility very clean and appealing.<br>Directions on the wall needs to be clearer and bigger,positive
"If I could leave a ""Zero"" star review, I would.<br><br>I had the displeasure of visiting a Medstar Promptcare facility where I was given incorrect information. The result was me getting charged an extra $200 for a simple follow up visit that resulted in an extra xray and the provider telling me to ""go to an orthopedic."" For that, I was charged $200. I called for 2 weeks in an attempt to speak to the facility administrator. I finally got a number to call her directly. I called Ms. Gregg on 2 occasions and sent two e-mails. After not hearing from her for 1.5 weeks, I decided to call and lodge a complaint against her and the facility for misrepresentation of services and an ethics complaint for her not returning my calls. Within 24 hours after this complaint, I got a call from Zal who was most helpful in explaining how everything worked. He said he did not know why Ms. Gregg did not return my phone calls, but offered to help me discern the breakdown of costs and see what the rates would be if I were directly billed instead of through insurance. He explained that the costs would have been higher through Aetna anyways, and that Aetna's global rate for their urgent care facilities is meant to keep costs down, that is of course unless you only go in for a follow up in which case the costs are MUCH higher than your normal primary care physician (I know this because I called a local physician's office here in PG county). On top of this, as I began to state that I just simply will not go to another Medstar Facility, he said ""well, this isn't really a Medstar issue, it's the high deductible health plan issue. You could have a lower co-pay and that's your only responsibility."" Which just set me off. How DARE you try to tell me what I COULD have! The ACA made it impossible for me to afford such healthcare because I make too much money to be allowed to get governmental assistance and yet I don't make enough to afford a $200 follow-up visit to your facility. So what did I learn from Medstar? It's not that I was given incorrect information from the provider...it's the fact that I can't afford any other health plans except for an HDHP. AVOID ALL MEDSTAR FACILITIES!!!!!",negative
Very good job by everyone I'm the office.,positive
Dr Medley is wonderful. She actually took the time to listen to me and went above and beyond to write a letter for me to give my employers about my condition.  I am truly grateful!,positive
The Medstar Primary Care at Navy Yard is extremely well run. There is an easy check in and then the appointments are right on time. Best is the great care by the health care professionals.,positive
I love Dr Sense and the staff. I have been a patient here for a long time. Dr Sense and the staff always make me feel that they care.,positive
"I can't believe I've allowed myself to keep returning here after 2+ years. When I've tried to call the office and speak to a human being, I have to wait through a long prompt, punch many numbers, and there was a period over more than a week when I was waiting to speak to a human and I was on hold forever, really. I'd be waiting for more than 20 minutes, during the day, normal operating hours, and nobody ever picks up the phone.<br><br>Also, when I came here to get a vaccine, that required 2 separate follow up shots, I came back and ran out and told me to pick up the vaccine at a pharmacy, which would've costed me hundreds of dollars. I mean, you run out, make no effort to restock, hide the fact that the fridge broke, I mean, this place is just sad. It might be a convenient location, but save yourself the stress and go somewhere else. They somehow make anything you want to do the most difficult thing possible.",negative
I meant my new doctor today the visit  was very pleasant she listened to me and she appeared to be concerned,positive
"Staff is friendly and helpful. Dr. Sistrunk is highly professional, very thorough, clear on explaining things and a friendly, welcoming person who puts patients at ease.",positive
"The doctor seems great but the front office staff has problems scheduling visits.  I make an appointment at the front desk and then the appointment is not scheduled.  This has happened 3 separate times.  It is very difficult to call them to make an appointment, I wait on hold for 20 minutes and then give up.",negative
Dr. Medley and the rest of the team were very attentive and went out of their way to help. They fit me into their schedule and took time to talk and check me out.,positive

Dr. Sylvia R. Medley did not explain lab results or medications she prescribed. The worst physician encounter in decades. Announced my lab results while standing in an open door way so anyone could hear. Lab results DID NOT INCATE what the physician diagnosed.,negative
"Dr. Annie Bailey is amazing. She is warm,   Intelligent and trustworthy. I felt safe in her care.",positive
"The front office and nursing staff are horrible. I've waited 30 min past my appointment on multiple occasions, not had messages relayed to my doctor, and treated like absolute trash every time I come in. I hoped the change to the new facility would help, but it seems to have gotten even worse.",negative
"Dr. Tyrone  is one of the most attentive, knowledgeable, and compassionate doctors I‚Äôve ever met. He truly listens, explains everything clearly, and takes the time to ensure you feel heard and cared for.

I‚Äôm truly grateful to have such a dedicated and skilled group taking care of my health. Highly recommended!",positive
Dr. Tara Sadr is the best doctor I‚Äôve met so far. She was so kind and informative. NP Amanda has also gone out of her way to contact me every step of the way. Only deducting one star because there‚Äôs no soundproofing and you can hear the conversations in other rooms.,positive
Imani and her assistant are a great team!!  Very calming and professional duo!  I almost forgot I was at a Dr's appointment.  I now look forward to my annual visits.  I hope they never stop working there!!,positive
"Dr. Aleskow is one of the very best internists in the region ‚Äî a doctor‚Äôs doctor.  He has a library of Knowledge and experience that he brings to the most routine of examinations, and the rigor and logic that he brings to sorting through the  myriad health issues in my life is unlike any PCP or internist I have Known. Some may find his intensity off-putting, as I once did when I first became his patient 25 years ago.  Of course, nothing could be less important given the wealth of intelligence and attention to detail behind that intensity.  Moreover, his network of specialists to whom he can refer his patients is second to none.  When my spine collapsed last year due to multiple myeloma, I lacked the mobility to see him in person in his downtown DC office, so I began seeing a PCP located next to my oncologist‚Äôs office in Reston.  That experience provided a stark reminder of the quality of care I have been receiving from Dr. Aleskow over all these years, and I was delighted and relieved to return to his care this year.",positive
"Highly recommend! Iman Lee is an incredible, compassionate, and thorough primary care provider. And I really appreciate her medical assistant, Stacy, who has such a warm, cheerful attitude that makes going to medical appointments so much more pleasant.",positive
"I‚Äôve had nothing but great experiences with CPCA, and this office was stellar. The staff are friendly, polite and effective. The environment clean and accessible. Street parking might be a challenge so I recommend a garage but if you‚Äôre okay with walking try the surrounding DuPont residential areas just a couple blocks away (free, 2-3 hr parking).<br><br>The wait times are not long and the patient portal is easy to navigate.<br><br>Highly recommend PA Nieves",positive
"I accompanied my partner to an appointment with PA Tyrone Nieves, and we were both extremely impressed by his care and professionalism.

"Good Experience - Front desk person was aloof and clearly did not like her job however my Provider Nurse Practitioner Rinali Patel and her Medical Assistant are top notch, Rinali is very thorough, friendly  and takes her time to make the Patient feel comfortable.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the wait time was  minimal, Rinali is my New Primary Care Provider.",positive
"I recently had a routine check-up with Dr. Darcy Hansen, and it was a wonderful experience. She was thorough, attentive, and made me feel completely at ease throughout the visit.

I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a great doctor who truly cares about their patients!",positive
"I'm so glad I found this place! I've been coming here for a couple of years and have worked with multiple physicians and I've always had a great experience. I'm seen without 10-15 mins of getting there and usually don't have to wait very long at all in the room before the doctor comes in.<br><br>Currently I'm working with Tara Sadr. She really made me feel heard and has provided great advice and next steps. We had to readjust a medication and she was excellent at listening to my concerns and finding a solution.

Tara Sadr is phenomenal! She makes me feel like more than just a patient. Very professional and knowledgeable as well.,positive

While I was waiting, there were multiple patients who informed the staff they had waited too long for their appointments, and walked out without seeing their doctor.<br><br>Following my appointment, I was told I would be contacted within 24hrs with routine bloodwork results. After weeks, I still have not been contacted. I try calling their number, but all their numbers go to voicemail aside from the 'schedule a new appointment' option.

I would recommend going with a local primary care doctor whose office you can contact directly.",negative
"The doctor I visited was entirely negligent: When I walked into my appointment room, they left the previous patient's file wide open including his social security number, medical conditions, etc. When I asked to speak with the manager of the facility, they never returned my call or treated my concern with any amount of legitimacy. I'd strongly recommend finding an alternative doctor.",negative
CPC is a very efficient and comprehensive primary care practice. I have been seeing Dr. Aleskow for many years and he's a very good doctor.,positive

His physician assistant took the time to hear me and was very responsive and smart. The clinic is clean and the staff professional.  I feel well taken care off here. Highly recommend.",positive
"My primary doctor Dr. Ghulam Abbas, MD is an excellent doctor I do not wait long when I go into the office. They call back the next day with my results. He is a very, very excellent doctor. Also easy to talk to and he very experience with the medical fields. The staff at his office is very nice they do an excellent job also",positive
"I requested to do a tele-visit appt back in late Nov, but the staff at the L street office wouldn‚Äôt agree to move forward with connecting me to the doctor unless my $25 balance was paid. ‚ÄúBalance,‚Äù I said? I had received one statement dated Nov 10 and is (now, was) due Dec 9.<br><br>Hard to speak due to laryngitis as part of my symptoms, but it was more important to them to get the $25 payment than provide care.<br><br>Note that my ins sent the explanation of benefits that showed they submitted a claim with two ‚Äònon covered‚Äô services (which was in fact a mistake on their part). Now I need to go back to them to get it resolved and re-submitted.<br><br>But, they got their $25 payment, which was by far their biggest concern.",negative
"This office is shockingly bad at managing prescription refills. Over the past year, I have requested prescription refills both through their portal and by calling their office and multiple times, with multiple prescriptions, it has taken them weeks or even months to refill them. It is irresponsible and dangerous. This is an okay office to go once or twice but you cannot rely on them as your PCP.",negative
"I was a patient of CPC for the past 14 years. They have good doctors , but the quality of the service at the office deteriorated drastically over the years. I have recently selected a new PCP. Unfortunately, the office has turned into a mechanical conveyor where you can't have your PCP's attention. During the last physical check appointment I had they have booked 4 other patients at the same time, so 4 of us sat in 3 separate rooms while a doctor they scheduled appoint for was desperately running back and forth between 4 different patients. Needless to say, neither of us got the treatment we came for. That is aside from the fact that I had to wait an hour for my turn to be briefly/momentarily seen. Last few years they also stopped giving authorizations to refill, so you are forced to call every three months and schedule a video visit to get your refill authorized. At one point my prescribing doctor was arguing with her own staff who were refusing to process HER request for refill, because the admin staff was adamant on scheduling unnecessary appointment (just a month after I took last labs). That is how desperate CPC is to charge your insurance company without any reason or need for it. I would stay away from PCP and find a better practice where it's not your insurance dollars but you as a patient matter.",negative
Dr. Aleskow was amazingly responsive and facilitated getting me into a specialist on the same day as my visit with him -- unheard of!,positive
"The practice is top notch!  The reception desk, the staff that welcomes you and takes your vitals and finally the doctors themselves are the best PCP's I have ever had.",positive
"I saw Dr. Abbas for my annual physical and in every way this was a positive experience.  The office, beginning with the intake/check in/ is efficiently run.  After checking in I waited no more than ten minutes and went for my vitals.  The PA was thorough and gave constructive feedback regarding the vital results. Dr. Abbas did a very thorough examination, did not appear rushed, asked questions based on my age, and answered all my questions.  The next day I received my lab results and Dr. Abbas notes and recommendations. This was a welcomed exam after the previous three doctors seemed satisfied that I was breathing and mentally together.  Those examinations were completed in about ten minutes before I was shown the door.  I'm grateful that there are still Primary Care physicians like Dr. Abbas who don't have the herd, processing mentality who are more concerned about spending too many minutes with a patient.   I strongly recommend Dr. Abbas.",positive
I loved Dr Nieves from day one!  Sorry to see him go but wish him the best future.,positive
"DR. Abbas is a fantastic doctor! He has a great bed-side manner and he is very responsive to questions both in-person and via the portal. The people in the office are very nice, as well. They also have a Lab Corp in the office which is perfect. You can get your labs done during your office visit, results usually in a day or two.",positive
Great doctors visit with Dr. Alesko and the in-house lab for drawing blood is a hugeee plus in my opinion. I didn‚Äôt even need to book an appointment to have my blood drawn as they are so flexible with scheduling. Would recommend to anyone.,positive
"I never leave reviews for medical offices but I‚Äôve had such great experiences here for primary care (&more) that I had to. Lab in office. And NP Khan is amazing ‚Äî thoughtful, thorough, great referrals, and quick responses in the portal too. I‚Äôve tried several doctors, primary care, and gynos around DC and this is hands down the best. I even moved outside DC but made an appointment here when I came back to DC for a visit because their care is superior.",positive
"Absolutely the best doctor appointment I‚Äôve ever experienced.  First, let me say that I am new to the DMV (from California).  My insurance was not offered on the East Coast, so I needed to select a new primary care physician.  A colleague recommended Comprehensive Primary Care, and I selected Dr. Darcy Hansen based on the extraordinarily high number of patient reviews citing her patience and listening skills.  They weren‚Äôt exaggerating - I‚Äôve never, ever had a conversation with a doctor of Dr. Hansen‚Äôs caliber.  Her clinical and practical expertise shine.  She answered all of my questions, educated my assumptions, and advocated my health and wellness plans.  She truly is part of the foundation I‚Äôm building for a healthier future, and with her (and Kim!) on my side, I know I‚Äôll reach my goals.  I can‚Äôt recommend Comprehensive enough - it‚Äôs been literally life-changing for me.  Thanks Dr. Hansen!  Thanks Kim! ‚Äî HC",positive
"I typically do not write reviews. Do not go here. I booked an appointment and when I got there they said they didn‚Äôt confirm it on their end. They rescheduled  me for later in the day and when I showed up not only did it take over an hour for a doctor to see me, but it wasn‚Äôt even the right one. There was also a giant cockroach in the lobby (doc mentioned this wasn‚Äôt the only one this week) along with no or very little AC on a 95 degree day. Highly recommend this place make some changes. I will not be back. Staff tried to argue with me knowing they told me something different earlier in the day.",negative
The best doctor office I‚Äôve been to. Everyone is caring and actually takes time to listen and respond with understanding. Love the staff and doctors.,positive
"The whole experience at the doctor office was stress-free and efficient from check-in, nurse taking vitals, Dr. Abbas consult ( asking questions as well as listening to my concerns), getting lab-work done at same facility.",positive
My Doctors at CPC takes very good care of me with all my health needs.,positive
"My review is of the L Street NW location in DC. Short wait times. I like Dr. Elliot Aleskow. He‚Äôs always willing to call a referral doctor to try to get you in same day. His referrals have been good. He also makes himself available via the app. He recently (4/16/25) called me in response to a message I sent via the app expressing concern regarding ongoing health issues. I missed the call, told him boss the app I was available and got a call back, again, from Dr. Aleskow. He himself is helpful and down to earth and has been helpful in saving me money on prescriptions. Sidra Khan was also helpful recently (11/24), providing a quick diagnosis and suggesting a specialist to see. He‚Äôs much easier to get an appt with than a specialist.",positive
"Great doctors, incompetent staff.<br><br>Doctor prescribed me antibiotics after a morning appointment but the staff did not send the prescription to my pharmacy. I had to keep calling all afternoon to get them to confirm sending it and they reassured me that they would send it. The office closed and they still never sent the prescription out. Called the after-hours doctor and she was able to send the prescription after I was put on hold for an hour. Meanwhile my strep throat was only getting worse and I could have started treatment earlier in the day but staff carelessness caused me to start the course 10 hours late.<br><br>The staff also misspelled my email address so I have not been receiving email updates or appointment confirmations. When I called to ask them to fix my email address on healow, the person who picked up the phone gave me attitude and told me I was calling the wrong number even though I was calling the number that‚Äôs on the website.",negative
"Dr. Rachel Solomon took care of me and she was absolutely wonderful. She was kind, smart, compassionate, and has excellent bedside manner. She also corresponded very quickly and gave me my results very fast. We even talked a bit about her upcoming trip to my home town:) The admin part of the office was also smooth and well run. It was my first time with her and I was extremely happy. Highly recommended!",positive
Had a positive experience from check in through final lab results. Staff was friendly and professional. Saw T. Sadr (PA) and found her to be attentive and spent the necessary time to both listen and explain. My appointment was for 1:00‚ÄìWas seen as scheduled!  (How rare!)  Recommend without hesitation.,positive
"My first visit was great. DR. LEE AND THE L street staff were great.<br>Will return in FEBRUARY, WHEN I come up from TRINIDAD",positive
"I recently came back to CPC after having a bad experience a number of years ago. I wish I hadn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt really seem to care about their patients. You are a $$ to them and nothing more. They will add appointments that are unnecessary as well as procedures without telling you it‚Äôs going to cost more until you‚Äôre surprised by the bill. Communicating with them is horrendous from their antiquated phone system to their admin staff who apparently never talk to the doctors themselves. All in all working with them has been an expensive, frustrating experience.",negative
"Dr Abbas was what my health needed.  He was precise, understanding and to the point. He has very good bedside manners.  He knew what would help with my condition just by me explaining it. He has helped me feel better but I had to do the work also.  Ms Brittany whom works for Dr Ghulam is a star. 5 stars by herself.  She interpret what the doctor noted, asking if I understand, showing genuine concern and delivering information with care. I appreciate a good team because you done know what a patient is going through when walking into the office. Kindness goes a long way. Thank you Team . Oh the labcorp team are nice as well.  Let's not forget them.",positive
"The doctor was nice enough.<br><br>Later I get the bill that they charged my insurance $400 for a service that I thought was included in the physical exam. I didn‚Äôt even ask for the service- it was offered to me without prompting and took about 1 minute, so I assumed it was included in the physical exam. Insurance only paid a portion of this and I was stuck with the rest of the bill. I called the billing office and they basically told me I have to pay it and there‚Äôs no recourse. This seems scammy to me- why did they not explicitly say I would be charged for this service? I would have refused the service when offered. Will not be returning.",negative
"Comprehensive Primary Care is very comprehensive!  They have all my health records in one place and go over everything.  I wish we had more time to discuss but if something comes up , I can always call and the records are all there in one place.  GREAT assistants to the Doctor, who I've know for forty years.",positive
"I moved from out of state with mostly bad experiences with previous doctors. Picked them from doing a Google search and their positive reviews. I feel like for the first time in years I found a doctor that cares on a professional and personal basis. Comprehensive Care is true to the name. Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Quick to get appointments,  results and needed follow-ups. It's also right across from Red Line station and L2 stop so good metro access.",positive
"It took me a while to find a doctor's office I liked after moving to DC, and I've really enjoyed the team at Comprehensive Primary Care and in particular, Dr. Hansen. I feel she listens to my concerns and takes time to answer questions and that is so valuable to me.",positive
The entire experience was efficient and very friendly. I waited about 5 mins after signing in to be seen. Pierce was very kind and personable when taking vitals. NP Rachel Solomon was amazing. She was caring and seemed genuinely interested in my health. I count myself as very lucky to have her as my health care provider! She called me directly for follow-up and even had me e-mail her with additional information. I was very surprised. Most doctors don't deal with you once you are out of their office. She made a serious effort. The patient portal they have set up is user friendly and I couldn't believe how fast my lab work was completed and available on their system. I was very impressed and plan to keep them as my primary for as long as I can.   - Augie,positive
"Very impressed with the medical personnel, but the check in process is awful.   After filling out a questionnaire online, they then ask the same questions on an ipad kiosk when you arrive.  After you do that, you get handed a clipboard where you have to handwrite everything you just put into the kiosk.  Really doesn't make a good first impression on their competency.",positive
"Absolutely the best medical practice in the entire district! Moving to DC from out of state posed a scare for me in finding a provider I could trust with my health. However, that fear was put to rest when I found Ms. Curtis. She always goes above and beyond to ensure my health is top tier. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone who wants to be seen as a patient and not just a number.",positive
"I followed my PCP Dr. Hansen to this practice, and even though I live a good 20-30 min drive from the practice now, I‚Äôm so happy to go to Comprehensive Primary Care. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the space is nice, modern, and very clean. And I can only speak incredibly highly of Dr. Hansen and Kim (who has been a great help with getting authorizations for prescriptions!).",positive
"I recently had a positive experience at the Comprehensive Primary Care, and I would like to share my review. The doctor was attentive and thorough, taking the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my questions. The facility was clean and well-maintained. Overall, I was very satisfied with my visit and would highly recommend this Primary Care to others.",positive
Dr. Hansen and her staff take care of her patients. You knowyou are getting thoughtful and complete attention.,positive
"My doctor joined Comprehensive Primary Care and my experience with her is better than ever. I was worried that in joining a larger medical group she would become harder to reach, but scheduling both in person and virtual appointments is a breeze. The office is run very efficiently and they have an app that allows you to see your test results among other things.",positive
"Dr. Abbas is very supportive, professional and does a great job in keeping me up-to-date on my tests, medications and vaccinations i need. I am very appreciative of the service of CPC and Dr. Abbas. Thank you",positive
"So horribly disorganized. They have messed up my prescriptions multiple times (e.g., wrong dosage, sent to the wrong pharmacy). They come off as completely careless. Not a practice who you want to trust with your well-being.",negative
"All of the staff is efficient, professional, and friendly. Simple but very clean setting in the waiting area. Rachel Solomon is a great PA-C, thorough, patient, personable. Blood test results came back fast, and Rachel personally called me with a follow-up to go over them even though there wasn't anything negative or alarming to cover. Really great experience overall from calling to schedule my first appointment to the follow-up from Rachel.",positive
Dr. Abbas is a very passionate Doctor who listen and cares about his patients. You are not just a patient to him and I could tell that on my very first visit. I have had s few Doctors in my lifetime but Dr. Abbas really stands out and deserves five stars. I know I'm in good hands with my Doctor! The overall experience with all the staff of Comprehensive Primary Care has been a very positive and amazing in one.,positive
"Woah!! Never have I been to a more efficient, yet caring doctor's office before! As a new patient I had no hassle getting the admin work completed and was seen on time. Rachel Solomon was outstanding and I couldn't say enough good things about her. She was attentive, listened to my concerns, and overall a kind person. Would definitely recommend this practice!",positive
"Every single individual I had the pleasure of interacting with had a phenomenal bedside manner, were very informed and informative, and I felt completely taken care of. Janet in reception was incredibly accommodating to a tight timeline I provided, and the main provider Dr. Abbas was so kind, positive, and  efficient. The lab techs were also just so upbeat and efficient.<br><br>I would absolutely recommend this location and these individuals for care, and I‚Äôm excited to have them as my primary care.",positive
"I had a great experience here. Everyone who works there -- from reception, to the doctors, to the nurses -- seems genuinely happy to be there. It's a very welcoming environment. Rachel Solomon was friendly and very thorough. I didn't feel rushed at all, and we were able to talk through all my questions. She also called me the next day to follow up on one of my questions. Overall a very good experience. I would definitely recommend Comprehensive Primary Care's L Street location.",positive
The staff was great from the office to the assistants checking me in. The app is super convenient and modern and I appreciate that I was taken back at my appointment time. Dr Abbas and Rachel were both wonderful to work with.,positive
"I was quite pleased with my husband's care when we visited last time. It's been a while, so I'm not too clear on the exact date. He saw NP Sidra Kahn and she did a thorough exam and prescribed  medications which resolved his symptoms. She explained everything she was doing and was respectful and polite with him. After her exam, she ordered his blood drawn. My husband has dementia so I was not sure how  he would react to being stuck with needles, etc., but the technician was also efficient and professional. My husband was comfortable during and after the procedure.",positive
"The best Medical experience, starting from front desk, all the way to Labcorp! My PA, Rachel Solomon, AMAZING and very easy to talk to. She was very knowledgeable, thorough and made me feel very comfortable my entire office visit. She made sure to explain each procedure and answer all my questions. She even called herself as soon as she had my results. PA Rachel Solomon is truly the best! you can tell she is caring and very dedicated!",positive
"New to DC and needed to find a new doctor. I chose Comprehensive Primary Care because they had pretty decent reviews and are close to where I live. I was happy and impressed with the friendly staff that helped set up my first appointment, and I was also happy with the Physicians Assistant (Rachel Solomon) that I chose to see. I've never seen a PA before; have always seen MDs. Rachel was great and thorough, and I'm happy with the level of care I received. She is also responsive with follow-up and answering questions.",positive
"Tyrone is amazing and answered all my concerns, all staff is so nice and helpful. I‚Äôve seen previous providers but none made heard or addressed my concerns as Tyrone did and the staff.",positive
"I have been seeing Dr. Aleskow for a very long time. I have always been very satisfied with the care and attention that I have received. He is honest and cares for you. He tells me things even if I don‚Äôt want to hear them like losing weight (I appreciate the honesty). He is caring and concerned. Always making sure he gets to the bottom of the issue by sending me to other doctors, or getting scans and blood work. He is friendly while maintaining professional and efficient standards of service. Everyone is so friendly. Each and every one of them are courteous, professional, and always make my visit as comfortable as they possibly could. I recently saw Dr. Abbas and he was also fantastic.<br>Thank you.",positive
"I had an excellent experience working with Dr. Abbas as my primary care physician. I would like to comment on patient care (mine) and the follow-up. During my recent interaction with him, he has provided excellent clinical care.  He ordered some lab work for me and the lab did not return the results on time. His office communicated with the labs to get the results back. Similarly, he helped me to sort out some glitches with the work with the pharmacy. Most importantly all the clinical and administrative work was done with a smile. After reviewing my results he recommended a new medication for my treatment.  I am happy with the clinical care under Dr. Abbas. He listens and works very hard to provide the best care.",positive
"I have been seeing Dr. Hansen for for 10+ years, so as always, her service is impeccable.  My visit was decent, I'll have to get use to her being in a group practice environment.  I HATE the online scheduling process.  It needs modifications to make it more efficient.",positive
"Dr. Abbas has provided me with exceptional service on a consistent basis. My recent visit on May 3rd,2024 was no exception. His bedside manners are outstanding. He is very professional and thorough in his examination. He always leaves you with good medical advice.",positive
"I have never met a less thorough, more dismissive and overall disrespectful primary care practitioner than Dr. Gulam Abbas. He has been my primary for about 2 years now and in this time he has misdiagnosed me and overlooked symptoms I have pleaded with him to look into. He is generally rude and terse and does not know how to listen. Today is my last going to Comprehensive Primary Care.",negative
"Since my primary doctor for the past 10 + years retired, he picked a awesome successor Dr. Abbas. Dr. Abbas and the entire staff at the L Street location are best/bomb.  They are always so professional and the atmosphere is so positive.  Dr. Abbas has a genuine heart and cares so much for his patients.  He take the time to address your concerns and answers any and all questions pertaining to your health.  He is not one of the those doctors that give a lot of medicines he is very honest and give you  the best medical advise.  His bubbly personality is a 10+ and the staff treat you like family.  If you call the doctor, he calls back and is very attentive to your health and needs.  My prior physician  , Dr. Tolbert could not have left me in better hands.  Thanks Comprehensive L ST Staff.<br>Kudos",positive
"Dr. Aleskow is my PCP for several years and had positive experience with him.  His office has very dedicated, and organized staff who are competent in what they do.  He is always attentive to his patients needs. One of the best Drs. I have experienced, who takes his time to talk to you, and follow up with you for any concern, and refer you to a specialist who is the best in town.   I love his office environment (specially his old office), they addressee you by your name,  they recognize you even on the phone (I missed Dana, Joe, Juan).  They have very flexible time, starting 6:45 a.m., so you can choose a time which works for you.  I am pleased that his my Dr. and always happy to refer him  to anyone who asked me.  Wishing him to be safe, and healthy!!",positive
"I did not have a good experience with this office- from the front desk team audibly complaining about their workplace to the office not calling to discuss bloodwork, I will not be coming back.",negative
"Rachel Solomon, PA is fantastic! I chose her as my new PCP based on her great reviews and location.  It was a great decision.  She kindly answered all of my questions and my visit was incredibly productive.  I highly recommend!",positive
"Awful office. Two months after her visit, my wife's migraine prescription has yet to be correctly filled despite multiple attempts at follow up. After being met with hostility, the front desk hung up on her with her most recent call. Not the mention the number of times she's been told her issues aren't real. Would not recommend.",negative
"I met with Dr. Aleskow for the first time and for a physical exam. I thought he was very thorough and asked questions and provided information about concerns I had that was very helpful. He came across as very knowledgeable. When I asked that some extra blood work be done, he kindly tracked me down while checking out to give me a heads up the lab may bill separately for it. He also followed up quickly with some referrals to other doctors I had requested and with my lab results. I also liked his nurse, who was very friendly and pleasant. So far, so good with this office, which is newly-renovated and very bright and comfortable. If it weren't for a cumbersome phone system and a scheduler who initially told me Dr. Aleskow wasn't taking new patients, though I've been with the practice for several years, I'd give five stars.",positive
Was a Lab Only visit for Dr.Aleskow.<br>Administrative staff is very cordial and knowledgeable. The lab staff is very personable and excellent at drawing blood painlessly. Dr.Aleskow personally phoned the next day to confirm my prescription had been called in to my pharmacy. I am a big fan!,positive
"I have had a positive experience at CPC the first few times I went when I met with Dr. Abbas. However, I went in recently and saw Dr. Darcey Hansen. She not only made a mistake twice when sending my prescription to the pharmacy, she did respond to the pharmacy's follow up nor my calls to sort out the issue. It has been over 48 hours since my appointment and I still do not have my medication. This is complete negligence and I put blame on both Dr. Hansen and CPC for allowing this to happen.",negative
"Great practice! Rachel Solomon PA-C is knowledgeable, kind and respectful. She listens attentively and provides the best medical advice. Front desk/receptionist staff and medical assistants are all very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend CPC!",positive
"So I felt compelled to leave this review because I have had such a terrible experience with the U Street Office and decided to give Comprehensive Primary Care another chance by trying a different office which is what brought me to the L Street Office - where I am now a faithful patient with Dr.Abbas. Establishing continuity of care is very important to me and so I was extremely displeased with overall experience at the U Street Office; from the lack of professionalism and the inconsitency in the care I would receive; I always felt like I was seeing a different Doctor every time I went to the U Street location and for someone like myself who struggles with anxiety and depression that was so incredibly frustrating because I would essentially have to explain my whole situation and treatment plan all over again every time which creates a deep lack of faith that I am being properly treated and followed up with accordingly. The L Street Office is such an incredible improvement from my previous horrible experiences with the U Street Office. Dr.Abbas and the L Street staff are incredibly professional, helpful, and attentive to their patients and their individual needs; they respond to calls, medication refill requests, appointment/reminders and everything in a very timely manner; I have never had any issues and/or difficulties contacting this office and getting whatever I have needed. Also, Dr.Abbas is very professional and compassionate provider; he is very dedicated to each patient and every appointment is thorough; you never feel as though you are getting rushed through it and he always ensures that you are given the appropriate time and care to voice any concerns and ask any question. There is always a sense of comfort in knowing that it's not just a ""check-up"" with Dr.Abbas; it is actually continuity of care. Highly recommend this office and Dr.Abbas!",positive
"The Doctors are good but the office personnel are rude and unprofessional, particularly in the billing department. I was just trying to resolve a billing issue coordination with my insurance. The first person I talked to hung up on me when I pressed on the fact that I had already spoken with the insurance. I called again and talked to a supervisor who treated me like I was an idiot. My problem was not resolved.",negative
I see Sidhra Khan FNP for primary care. She listens and is compassionate. I have been impressed by the breadth of her clinical expertise. If she refers it‚Äôs always been for a good reason and she has a good specialty network. She really helps me manage my complex multiple conditions. I am more confident in my outlook because of her care.,positive
"From check-in until you leave, everyone in this office is professional and very friendly! PA Rachel Solomon is the best! She takes the time to find out if there have been any changes or concerns since your last visit and LISTENS! My Dr retired and I'm glad I gave this office (that took over the practice) a chance. I live in Maryland, but it well worth the trip to have such a pleasant service. They are the ""unicorn"" of practices!",positive
"The computerized check in continues to be cumbersome and time consuming, but once I saw the doctor and the assorted support  personnel things went smoothly. I was very pleased that someone called me to tell me blood results and did not try to forced to use  an account/portal to obtain the information.",positive
I've had nothing but great experiences with CPC. Dr. Abbas is helpful and thorough and has a very pleasant manner...something I don't take for granted. I appreciate that he is on top of the latest medical advice and is accessible for questions. I also appreciate that I can have tests done at their facility without having to make another appointment elsewhere....much more convenient. I highly recommend this care group.,positive
"Been going to Dr. Aleskow for years. I've always found him to very thorough, and extremely responsive. On more than one occasion, he called other doctors and persuaded them to see me immediately, just to be sure a problem I was having wasn't serious. Meanwhile, he convinced my husband to have a PSA test in his early 40s -- which probably saved his life. So, yeah: 5 stars",positive
"I did not have to wait beyond my appointment time. The nurse who took my history was quite thorough, but also very pleasant. Dr Aleskow also was very thorough in his examination of me, but very pleasant and very clear in his explanations of what he was doing and what he was finding. Finally, the woman who drew my blood was able to stick the needle into my arm without my feeling even any discomfort, let alone any pain. All in all, this was a fantastic annual exam.",positive
"Through and through top level professional care and sensitive, considerate approach.",positive
"Staff was great, almost no wait time, easy to get an appointment, doctor was very consideration and responsive to all concerns, needed a follow up and was able to come in the next day",positive
"I have been using Dr. Elliot Aleskow as my primary care physician for about 30 years. I have always found him to be an excellent doctor.  I was concerned when he closed his private office on K Street and feared that he might be preparing for retirement.  I followed him to Comprehensive Primary Care and was relieved to find that he was as active and effective as ever.  The new facilities are excellent and all the support staff are very capable and courteous,",positive
"Fast and efficient, and on time. They take blood, which saves a trip to a separate lab. Only complaint is I get referred out more than I‚Äôd like. I was disappointed to be referred to a doctor who took my insurance card, then I waited 2.5 hours for a 10 minute consultation and now he wants $300. If I billed him for MY TIME, he‚Äôd be upset because he‚Äôd owe ME. Check all referrals and ask specifically if they take your insurance. Them agreeing to see you isn‚Äôt confirmation enough",positive
"Everyone is always welcoming and helpful.  My internist, Darcy Hansen, MD, is the best imaginable.  I treasure her care and advice.  Her Assistant Kim goes out of her way to provide service. I am very happy with Comprehensive Primary Care.",positive
Dr. Abbas is an attentive physician. Appointments occur on time (as scheduled). I'm very pleased with my health care under Comprehensive Primary Care.,positive
"My overall experience at CPC was excellent.  The office staff were friendly, efficient and professional.  Wait time to begin the exam was about 10 minutes.  The nurse practitioner that took my vitals was lovely and calm - just what you need on a first time visit.  Dr. Aleskow was attentive and listened to my concerns.  He also explained what he was doing every step of the exam and was very conscientious about calling me with my lab results and recommendations for next steps.  I had a wonderful experience at CPC.  I can highly recommend.",positive
"I have been without a PC for about 2 years, my Co-worker recommended her new PC, Dr. Darcy Hansen. Glad I took her up on her recommendation! Dr. Hansen is a Gem!! Very thoughtful, very thorough!! üíØ% satisfied!",positive
"The service I receive is always Great from the time I step into the office, being greeted by the office staff  with such pleasantries as you check in. From triage through and seeing the doctor is a positive experience.  I never feel rushed and Dr Abbas truly  listens to my concerns  and  gives great recommendations and advice.",positive
"Dr. Darcy Hansen was super professional and patient when she saw me. She took her time to explain my health issues, allow me to ask questions, and provide several options to solve them. Thank you for everything Dr. Hansen!!¬† Comprehensive Primary Care (in 19th Street location) is highly recommended!",positive
"Worst primary care experience of my life. Treated like cattle, no privacy or humanity shown to patients, it was clearly just getting as many people through the system as quickly as possible. I was shocked that I had my physical in the same room as another man, only separated by a curtain and a few inches and we could fully hear each other's conversations. I was not given an opportunity to ask questions about my health, just rushed through a series of tests that were not explained to me. Will definitely not be returning here.",negative
"My doctor, Dr. Darcy Hansen, is most excellent.  I did not receive any information from any other doctor.  The only othere person I spoke to was the woman who took the reading of my pressure and then took the tests to see if I had the coronavirus, and concluded that I have not have that disease.<br><br>John Cooney",positive
"Rachel Solomon (PA) is my PCP here and does a fantastic job. The office is run very efficiently and everyone else who I have met there has been friendly and professional. I appreciate the telemedicine flexibility and they have a well-functioning online portal where I can request refills, ask questions and see any lab results. Been going here over a year and I‚Äôm very glad I picked CPC!",positive
Nice to see some of staff made transfer from Dr Taubin's office after his retirement.  Excellent staff.,positive
"Dr. Morcom has been my PCP for over 3 years and I told her she‚Äôs not allowed to leave this practice (I‚Äôm only 65% joking). She‚Äôs amazing, thoughtful, compassionate, and very patient with this patient. I have autoimmune issues and she has been the best PCP I‚Äôve had to help me navigate all of this and I finally am starting to have some answers because of her care. I highly recommend her, especially if you have complex medical issues.",positive
"Excellent & expedient service!  I came from a doctor's office that would have me wait anywhere from 30min-1hr+ no matter what time of day I scheduled my appointment.  Dr. Abbass and his staff saw me exactly when my appointment was scheduled, provided all the care & attention I needed, sent my prescriptions to the pharmacy that same morning, and followed up to let me know of my blood test results & to ask if there was anything else I needed from them.  I have been experiencing a minor health affliction for almost ten years for which I saw dozens of different doctors/specialists for.  Dr. Abbass listened to my symptoms and recommended medications that have already shown me a massive improvement in my symptoms.  I have only seen Dr. Abbass once, but I can already tell I made the right decision to switch PCPs based on his knowledge, experience, and hard-working/efficient/caring staff.",positive
"I was able to get an appointment quickly, and everything went very smoothly before and during the appointment.  After the appointment, I was told to have another blood test but unfortunately I was given no instructions how to set that up at the practice's in-house lab.  The online portal for the practice doesn't allow for scheduling blood tests.  If I am able to walk in without an appointment, I would like to be told that.  Otherwise, I was happy with the whole experience, including the detailed information provided through the online portal.",positive
"Very nice staff, and got me in even several minutes early<br>Dr. Abbas was very nice and very thorough. He explained everything in detail to me and took the time to answer questions. Ended up getting vaccine and some blood work and the nurses are very efficient and make it about as pain free as possible when getting stabbed with a needle.",positive
"Dr. Aleskow is easily the best primary care provider in the Washington, DC area.  He's been my provider for well over two decades and without exception, has provided the best and most knowledgeable care possible, and always with a smile and encouraging word.  He is also 100% genuinely caring of your health.  Thank you, Dr. Aleskow!",positive
"Dr. Abbas performed my USCIS Immigration Medical Examination and I couldn't have been more disappointed with his services and this clinic. Multiple parts on my sealed medical exam written by Dr. Abbas were missing and/or incomplete - I only found this out during my Immigration Interview after they opened the sealed file and this was the only reason I did not pass on the spot. Shame on you, you should not hold this special designation to perform this exam when you lack accountability, professionalism and ultimately care. I urge you not to come here for your medical needs, if he can be this negligent over a simple and basic form for a healthy young woman what will he miss for someone who is ill? Not only did he waste my $500+ for this exam, he wasted my time and efforts & kept me away from visiting my family back home for extra months. When I asked the clinic for any form of refund the lady at the front desk just laughed at me.",negative
I‚Äôm very grateful to have found comprehensive primary care on L st since my move from the west coast. The staff is very kind and helpful. My experiences with my provider and the nurses have been amazing as well.,positive
"Dr Abbas has amazing professionalism, punctual, courteous, thorough and insightful. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better PCP!",positive
New to the practice but I have found them to be exceptionally kind and efficient.

You could tell they were very very busy but they still had time for me.,positive

"Dr. Abbas is knowledgeable, a good listener with great bedside manners. I feel comfortable with the health care I received. His staff  is awsome; they answers the telephone and return  calls promptly.",positive
I have been a patient of Dr. Aleskow for over 20 years.  I have always known him to be compassionate and caring.  He is accessible when you need him.  And the other doctors that he may refer you to are tops in their field.  I highly recommend him and his practice.,positive
The office was very clean. The staff was friendly and professional. Dr. Aleskow has been my physician for many years and I am still pleased and confident in his medical care.,positive
Nice office and staff. Dr. Abbas was great!  I was previously with Dr. Shotashvili in the Woodley Park office and was not treated well and my time was not valued. This was a MUCH better experience.  Dr. Abbas and the L Street staff are a much better choice for me.,positive
Best location for comprehensive primary care. The physicians actually listen to concerns and provide care.,positive
"The kindest front desk, medical staff and physicians. I love that the lab is in the facility as well. My PA, Rachel, explained everything to me in words that I could understand, and called me herself with results. I will absolutely be switching my PCP to this practice.",positive
"Great practice with streamlined processes, from those fancy check in tablets to only a few paper signatures. Office is recently refreshed. Staff are the best part, from check in to the pre-appointment routine to the doctors to check out. Fantastic across the board.",positive
"Dr. Abbas and his staff are the best!  Courteous, responsive, and professional.  In fact, I had a follow-up question about a lab result, contacted the doctor online, and received an IMMEDIATE phone call with a full explanation regarding my inquiry!  Bravo!",positive
"Kind staff. Sidra Khan, NP is not only wonderful, but an excellent practitioner. Has helped in numerous ways outside her perview, ie gave support when my dog died, helped me achieve weight-loss goals, without having to give up cookies. Has time to listen. Appreciate short waiting room time for appointments, + ability to get appointments that fit into my schedule.",positive
"Dr. Hansen spent quality time with me. She listened and I felt she heard what I said and she answered my questions in plain language. She asked me vital questions and gave me good, clear advice.",positive
"They are my primary care and every time I‚Äôve gone the staff has always been nice and professional during my in person and virtual visits. The provider I see is also very nice and knowledgeable, takes her time and listens to all my concerns and makes sure to address each one of them which I appreciate.",positive
"I had a very satisfactory experience at the L Street office of Comprehensive Primary Care. Dr. Abbas was efficient, asked good questions, and listened to mine. The nursing staff had great senses of humor and took blood samples and provided vaccines almost painlessly.",positive
Went for an appointment with Tara Sadr and it was very efficient! She and her assistant were very knowledgeable and the office staff was very friendly.,positive
"My physician Darcy Hansen is great, a 5+, but the computer program supporting the Patient Portal sucks!  The only part that works is ""pay your bill"".  When trying to set up an account, send a message, etc., a banner covers half the screen and cannot be removed or decreased in size, forcing one to complete information in the lower half of screen only.  It took me 5 or 6 tries and 45 minutes to sent up my account.  Then, when I tried to send a message (because there is no way to send an email using my standard email system), the Comprehensive Primary Care System logged me out when I clicked the ""Submit"" button.  All the computer issues are made more critical because the office seldom personally answer the phones but requires one to leave a message which will be returned within ""24 to 48 hours.""  I could be dead by then.   IT should test all parts of system, not just pay your bill.",negative
"I have a gash on my leg which I ignored. When it became infected my Doc of 10 years could not see me for 4 Weeks.  My husband asked his doc if anyone at CPC could see it.  I got an appointment that day. After my initial visit with his Doc, I am being treated by his FPA and am receiving excellent care both by phone, virtually and in person.",positive
"I've been seeing Dr. Aleskow at his previous practice for several years for routine visits. He's a fine primary care guy who prefers to refer folks to appropriate specialists for particular problems, which I am fine with. The nursing staff is friendly and professional and well-informed, and seem well-supported by the practice -- the practices that take the best care of their patients are going to be those that take the best care of their nurses, NPs, technicians, and other employees.",positive
I had an amazing experience with Rachel Solomon! She was very knowledgeable and friendly and answered all my questions and concerns. The staff at the front desk was also very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend!,positive
"I've been seeing Dr. Aleskow for nearly 30 years.  He is an excellent and very thorough physician, and has referred me to many excellent specialists over the years.  I like the new practice, notably that i can send a message online and get a call back either from Dr. Aleskow or from a PA.  I also like seeing my lab results online.",positive
"Went for annual physical--first since Dr. Taubin retired earlier this year.   Did not wait long; Dr. Abbas, Nurse Ebony, and lab personnel were very friendly, attentive, and showed genuine interest in patient wellbeing.  In house lab makes it a one-shop stop.  Lab results were back in a day, with follow-up call by Dr. Abbas with explanations and constructive recommendations.",positive
"Dr. Aleskow has been my primary care physician for more than 25 years. He runs an efficient office with very few problems. He is a caring doctor, using the whole of the Washington medical community to support his service.",positive
Excellent and efficient quality service.<br>Dr. Aleskow and Dr. Abbass are very responsive and caring.<br>The support staff are also very professional.<br>Cannot thank them enough. Highly recommended.,positive
"Comprehensive Primary Care does not honor appointments and they simply do not care. I made an appointment request online on June 15th. On June 16th, I received an email that my appointment had been confirmed. Today, I took time off work and showed up ten minutes before my appointment time. The doors to the building were locked so I called and the woman on the phone let me know that office was closed today. I asked why and how I was allowed to make an appointment, and she told me I was confused and must have just requested one. I then read her my confirmation email and she had nothing to say and did not even apologize. I continued to ask how this was possible and if I could be seen at another location, as all of their other offices were open. She told me I could not, and asked when I'd like to be rescheduled for. When I was explaining that I did not know when I could reschedule for, as I had to once again take time off work, she hung up on me. I'm appalled by the treatment I received here and CPC's lack of organization, customer service, and ability to own their mistakes. Unfortunately, I will be finding a new practice.",negative
"Dr Elloit Aleskwo, has been my physician for the past 18 yrs, very articulate, knowledgeable, and professionally friendly, he always has a big smile, when he told me he was moving to CPC, l didn‚Äôt hesitate to ask for the address to continue been his patient.

"Tried to make an appointment, but the women who answered the phone was extremely rude and dismissive. She then hung up when I told her my insurance. If this is how this provider clinic treats patients, I want nothing to do with it.",negative
"After years of seeing Dr. Taubin I was disappointed that he decided to retire, but understand his decision. I was also unsure of what this meant when I eventually needed to see a doctor again. I saw Dr. Abbas this week and all of my apprehension is gone. He was attentive and thorough. I‚Äôm now very comfortable making the change to a new primary care physician which could have been a stressful transition.",positive
I have been seeing Dr Aleskow for more that 20 years so moved to Comprehensive care with him. He is a terrific caring physician and both phone and in-person interactions with the staff has been excellent,positive

"Everyone were so friendly and helpful.  Dr. Miknowski is my primary care physician, but I was able to see Dr. Abbas. He diagnosed my problem right away, and, even called me at home the next day to discuss the results of a test.",positive
Had some issues but the manager at the location got in contact and was very helpful. Conneced me with Dr. Abbas who was extremely professional and thorough,positive
"CPC added Dr Elliott Aleskow to their practice and what a value add to it.  Dr. Aleskow has been my internist for over two decades and there just aren't adequate words to express how skilled, talented, caring, and compassionate a physician he is.  He has taken care of me and my family throughout the years; detecting medical problems early and securing only the top flight care to address any special conditions.  He is responsive, thorough, and genuinely cares for the well being of all of his patients.  I have seen a range of physicians throughout the years and truly no one holds a candle to his knowledge, approach and bedside manner.  He is regarded so highly by his peers, he has received the top docs ratings for years and he has large network of trusted specialists to draw from when needed.  He works for the patient always and with such heart and responsiveness like I have never seen.  While I miss his staff from his original practice, my two experiences thus far with his new staff have been very positive.  He knows how to build and inspire a physician's team and CPC has scored a treasure, without a doubt.   Ann Calvaresi Barr",positive
"for the first time in a long while, i feel like my primary care doctor/PA and her office is laser focused on customer service. i'm Really Happy that this is my new primary care doctor's office!<br><br>Upon my 2nd visit, I still feel the same.",positive

"Dr. Sidrah Khan single handedly demonstrates the level of care and empathy desired from all medical professionals. From being available to schedule a same day appointment for a minor emergency, to supportively figuring out an immediate solution (beyond the services of Comprehensive Primary Care), and then following up personally to ensure the issue was treated and I was well. I was so utterly impressive by her depth of care and personal investment in my health and could not more strongly recommend her or this office.",positive
Dr. Abbas has great bedside manner; outstanding customer service from ALL the ladies at the front desk. Everyone is professional and provides excellent service when needed.<br><br>Office Location is very convenient,positive

"Don't go here if you'll need anything in a timely fashion- it took ten days to get a letter for my employer, as well as 5 days of full on phone tag when the staff wouldn't send any information via the portal. Also, I asked multiple times about my workers comp claim only to be told AFTER I was billed that they couldn't help me with workers comp. Extremely rude staff- people argued with me saying that I hadn't shared my e-mail when I had multiple times, and kept interrupting me.",negative

"Internal Medicine at MedStar Washington DC Hospital; Center is a well run clinic. Although I could see my :primary Care Physician in his private practice I prefer the clinic.  Having a lab on site is just one of the conveniences -- no hunting a lab making another appointment and then going to said lab.<br><br>But what I REALLY like is that this clinic is part of Washington Hosptal which is a teaching hospital.  This means in the clinic I often see a Resident in addition to my PCP.  I like the mix of doctors on their way to starting their independent careers.<br><br>For me, different viewpoints is a plus.  Visits w/ a resident is always followed up w/ my PCP.  After seeing the resident they confer w/ my PCP.  Then both of them return to report on their analyses and recommendations.   This means I see TWO professionals and get a lot longer than 15 minutes where the physician is greeting me on the way into the exam room and summarizing their recommendations on their  way out the door to their next 15 minute appointment.<br><br>The clinic also takes Medicare and Medicaid.  No small feat these days.<br><br>Sometimes the waiting room is overstuffed with people waiting for their appointment and you.wonder when your name will be called.<br><br>Sometimes I have to wait to start the appointment. If you have some patience I believe you will find the pluses of using the clinic as beneficial as I do.  I recommend this clinic.<br><br>Ann - Washington DC",positive
"Hello, our experience was great. We were seen at an adequate time. The nurses, doctor, and staff were very polite, caring and pleasant.

I was very pleased and personally I just want to say thank you very much.<br>Patrick Noise's dad.<br>William.",positive
"Great service. Received referrals from my primary care physician, which is a new primary care physician unfortunately one of my referrals went to a wrong doctor however, they called me to inform me that they received the information and I need to get in touch with my doctor to let them know what was wrong. And the assistant took the information and ran with it and provided me the correct information that was needed.",positive
"At first I didn't like the fact that you will see different physicians and you will be scheduled with someone different most times. I'm used to one doctor my entire time. As I thought about it, id rather see different physicians because one may see what the other missed. Not everyone think the same. So that's a plus for me, more than one opinion. Thanks Medstar but please don't schedule patients close to closing anymore. It doesn't feel respectful, the clinic is 80 percent closed, while there are still patients inside.",positive
"I have enjoyed coming here or years. Staff is friendly, my doctor is the best. I have recommended him to several friends. They have made some changes, so when I come, I don't have to wait long anymore . üëç",positive
It‚Äôs so sad how there is no compassion any more. Sometimes people forget patience. The staff are always overwhelmed overworked and underpaid but we as communities can do better by showing them we understand and giving them some thank you and we appreciate you and trust me that goes a long way! I appreciate the Washington Hospital Center for giving me the care that they do.,positive
Had my 1st appt to establish care here and had an awful experience. I went to the downstairs clinic with the residents/interns. I was told I‚Äôd see a resident and then see the doctor I was scheduled with. No one told me I wasn‚Äôt going to see the doctor I was scheduled with or so much as mentioned her name during my appt. I needed referrals for specialists in the area since I just moved and the (male) resident Dr. Torosian literally argued with me on why they weren‚Äôt necessary (even though other more senior providers have told me I need to see these specialists). He was so rude and dismissive of my medical history and he barely even looked at me during my appt.   I‚Äôve never felt so embarrassed to bring a medical concern to a provider in my life. Would not recommend this clinic. Seems chaotic and unorganized.<br><br>I already plan to file a complaint with the hospital.,negative
"When visiting WHC and selecting a PCP, I suggest Dr. Heidi Durden. She recalls new patients quickly and why they are being treated without consulting a chart or notes. She senses hidden trauma‚Äôs and is able to care for the patient on a personal level. I have referred her to family.",positive
"I checked 15 minutes early for my appointment and left an hour and 50 minutes later without being seen. What use to be a 10-minute wait has spiraled into inestimable wait times.I have been a patient at this facility for over twenty years. Since Dr. Cole left, things seem to be consistently in chaos.",negative
My new favorite PCP Dr. Tran and assistant Dr. Wie was very professional caring and friendly. They took times to explain in details relating to my symptoms.  They answered all my questions and concerns in a way to make sure I get a full understanding.,positive

Tran, your approach to your patients makes a huge difference to them and to me.<br><br>Your dedication to improving the lives of others and mine is greatly appreciated.<br><br>Additionally, I appreciate the extra help from Dr. Al Zureikat and the changes in the department.

My heads was all over the place when I found out I was going to 1A50A, I said oh no, this place. Now the young lady at the front desk with dreads to left, very helpful.  The ones to the right always like that laughing and gossiping,  are whatever they do in that corner.",positive

"Administration is very inefficient.  (1) hard to find where the entrance is.  (2) hard to find where you need to register and wait.  The signs are bad.  (3) registration waiting time is  half a hour. (4) it took a long time to get someone (at least 30 minutes) to move me to the lobby to leave.  The facility, doctors, nurses are very good, however.  Tasks are chopped into too fine pieces, and there are way too many people involved, so the coordination is bad, many idle people around, and patients pay.",negative
My last experience at Washington hospital center emergency room in December 2024 this month was unbelievable. They treated me with respect and all nurses and doctors were wonderful. My previous experiences were not so welcoming but I played my part in it and was partially responsible and send my sincere apologies for everything. Thank you for everything,positive

"17 Sep, on/about 10:30pm - This is specifically for the check in desk and triage nurse.  We were transferred from another ER since they didn‚Äôt have an eye doctor and the medical team called ahead to let the team know we were coming and to take us directly to the eye doctor vs waiting in the ER waiting room for a possible emergency surgery.  Upon checking in and explaining everything to the front desk, with no bed side manner or people skills, says ‚Äúyou have 157 people ahead of you and we are busy you need to wait‚Äù.  I totally get they have a procedure, but if I explained everything and had a sealed envelope, why wouldn‚Äôt you call the eye clinic to confirm?  Instead we got a nasty attitude‚Ä¶ in the medical field or customer service field, it is so important to have people skills that will allow them to be at ease and most important to have good listening and communicative skills to better help the patient and medical field in general.",negative

I  loved their professionalism, and you get the feeling and comfort that they cared. Dr. King was awesome. He listened and engaged you in the conversations, which made you feel comfortable speaking to him  about yourself, your health, and any progress that you think you have made. Its very important for patients to have these interactions with their provider and team. Whether you receive a great report card or one that's not so good, leaving with a feeling that you are in good hands with the service your care team provides means a lot to any patient. Knowing that you have a team that cares keeps your hope alive.<br>Awesome and caring team.<br>Thank you üòä üíì",positive

After 25+ years with one primary care provider (PCP) I needed a new one. I easily made an appointment at the primary care clinic not know what to expect. I got an appointment within 2 days. I was seen by a very competent 3rd year resident. I knew that he would soon be leaving for a post somewhere else and asked who would be my doctor when he left. He then introduced me to his attending physician. After reviewing his work she told me that she would become my new PCP. I could not be more pleased with all aspects of the care I have received since then.,positive

It turns out my A1C was 16 and my sugars were over 650!

"I‚Äôve had an amazing experience with One Medical! From the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly welcoming and genuinely kind. They really make you feel like you matter. My doctor, in particular, is outstanding ‚Äî so attentive, knowledgeable, and truly cares about my well-being. It‚Äôs refreshing to find a doctor's office where you don't just feel like a number. The level of care and personal attention is top-notch, and I can't recommend them enough!",positive
"One Medical (Union Station office) did an excellent job during my most recent appointment, as they always do. I scheduled with a PA for this visit. He carefully listened to me, thoroughly examined my symptoms and then recommended a treatment. I was able to get an appointment almost immediately. Very professional. I highly recommend!!!",positive
"Shobhna Shukla is an exceptional provider in my experience. Very considerate, incorporates me in decision making, and provides guidance that has produced great results. It has taken me a long time to find a provider I connect with/have full confidence in and will definitely be staying.",positive
"I was recommended to One Medical by my spouse, as it seemed similar to my previous primary care provider. I joined on Friday, December 6, 2024, but my experience has been extremely disappointing.<br><br>I recently received a bill from Labcorp for $992.25 and reached out to One Medical for clarification. To my surprise, they told me to contact Labcorp directly, which I found unacceptable. With previous primary care providers, billing issues involving insurance were always handled by the office, as it is their responsibility to ensure claims are processed correctly.<br><br>When I contacted Labcorp, they informed me that One Medical had failed to send my insurance information along with my blood work. This oversight was entirely their fault, yet I was left to resolve the issue myself.<br><br>To make matters worse, the person I spoke to at One Medical was dismissive and showed no accountability for their mistake. They didn‚Äôt even offer an apology for the inconvenience caused.<br><br>This lack of professionalism and poor customer service is unacceptable. I expected far better and, unfortunately, feel this experience warrants a one-star review.",negative
"It's such a breeze to get medical care from One Medical, and this location is superb.  One Medical now has a comprehensive plan to support you for international travel, and after completing my online form, I was reminded to come in for a recommended vaccination. The walk-in lab hours made it easy - I was in and out within 15 minutes, with the assurance that my vaccine dose had already been recorded in my file. I love that any kind of appointment I might make - for a sick visit or annual exam - that my time is respected and I am seen within minutes of my appointment time.",positive
I highly recommend One Medical at Union Station location. Dr. Baik was terrific. She was very knowledgeable and addressed all of my issues. She was very kind. Everyone at the office was friendly and professional and there was minimal waiting to see the Dr and for lab work. Very nice atmosphere and very clean.,positive
"I want to highlight Drew Roenneburg - He is a kind, approachable and caring medical professional who‚Äôs bed side manner tops any medical professional I have dealt with. Drew thoroughness and communication is evident from the moment you sit down with him, where he not only satisfies my immediate medical concerns but also details a long term care plan that puts you at ease. Without fail Drew follows up with me via the One Medical App and during everyone one of our in-person visits. I‚Äôve had many PCMs over the years, and amoung them Drew ranks as the best!",positive
Just had a very helpful Zoom appointment with a care provider at Union Station. She listened to my concerns and gave me a referral for an X-ray. Everything was smooth and efficient and the doctor was friendly and helpful. She also helped me access some coupons for discounted prescriptions. Highly recommend.,positive
"N.P. is very competent, professional and friendly. I recommend her.  Service was quick although I did get a hematoma from the blood draw. Facilities clean and modern. Administrative staff efficient and engaging.",positive
"Staff, nurses, and doctors are all lovely and professional. Great at keeping to scheduled appointment times. Visits have been quick and efficient.",positive
"I an extremely happy with Jennifer Barnwell, NP.  She is knowledgeable, professional and best of all caring. She takes time to listen to my concerns and provide possible solutions. She responds to emails in a timely manner. I have never had any issues with making appointments or the wait time for the appointment. The Union Station Office waiting area is always calm and relaxing. I have found the Front Office staff to be friendly and helpful. The same can be said for the on-site lab technicians. I am so happy that I found Jennifer Barnwell, NP and One Medical.",positive
"One Medical is a game changed for health in this country. I had been struggling to find a primary care provider for over a year with my insurance. All contact info for doctors and nurse practitioners on their website is outdated. The website itself seems intentionally hard to use. I had the best experience with One Medical. Not only was it effortless to schedule an appointment (for the next day nonetheless!), my new primary care provider is focused on preventive medicine, which is exactly what I have been wanting to find (so rare in this country). Without my having to ask she ordered blood work that previous doctors denied to me even though I begged for them. The appointment started exactly on time and the bloodwork was done right after. I also love how all of the lab results are accessible in the One Medical app and how I can message my PCP directly. Lastly, the integration with Amazon Pharmacy makes it seemless to order my thyroid meds and to keep my dose in check. I could not recommend One Medical more strongly. The price is so friendly for prime subscribers. I will never use any other service for my health needs.",positive
I've been a one medical patient for four or five years. If your appointment's at 10:00 a.m. the clinical provider is their greeting you at 10:00 a.m. they are efficient at managing the appointment times. If you need a long visit then book a long visit. Previous to one medical I have fallen asleep in the patient room because the doctors took so long to get to me.,positive
"At my last appointment, my PCP, Esther Baik, accused me of seeking surgical intervention for scoliosis (which I don‚Äôt desire) because I was wary about her recommendation of acupuncture for back and neck issues and she also warned me against trying to get her to ‚Äúsay bad things‚Äù about other doctors when trying to get a recommendation for a specialist. When I first started seeing her, about a year ago, I asked if she could prescribe a pretty common and manageable anxiety medication, one that I had experience with in the past, and she said she wouldn‚Äôt prescribe it because she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to have to keep up with that.‚Äù I was to understand that ‚Äúkeeping up with that‚Äù is part of a doctor‚Äôs job, but perhaps I‚Äôve been mistaken. If anything, that incident alone should have told me everything I needed to know about the quality of care I would be receiving from Esther and One Medical.<br><br>Additionally, One Medical‚Äôs subscription appears to have cost me double what it‚Äôs supposed to cost Prime members, so there are administrative issues, too. Otherwise, this review might have made two stars for the decent location.",negative
"Top notch medical facility.  Friendly, professional, and diverse staff.<br>They make going to the doctor seem less daunting.  Best investment ever!",positive
"Chris, one of the lab technicians, is the nicest healthcare professional I‚Äôve ever come in contact with. He clearly cares about his job and the comfort and safety of his patients. I hate getting my blood drawn but he made me feel totally comfortable. He even made a note in my chart noting the vein he used so that other technicians could access it easily in the future without having to poke around.",positive
"This is one of the best doctors offices I have ever been to. The providers truly care about their patients and they really take extra steps to ensure you are welcomed and comfortable in this office. The whole process was seamless, not rushed but not slow, and phenomenal. Don‚Äôt listen to the negative reviews for silly things.",positive
"I‚Äôve had a great experience here, which says a lot because I‚Äôve had some significant medical trauma in my life. NP Barnwell is my primary and she‚Äôs efficient and thorough. I saw Dr. Sohail for a complicated, urgent issue and he was phenomenal. When I finally was able to see a specialist a month later, she was super impressed by the tests he ordered, which were the same ones she would have ordered, saving me a massive amount of time and unnecessary worry! The phlebotomist that took my blood sample was kind and efficient. I really appreciate having a super easy app to use, which I‚Äôve often needed in a pinch when some other provider needed the referral ASAP.  It‚Äôs just there in the app with a share button. Totally worth the membership fee.",positive
"I love One Medical but most of all I love my Dr. Shabonahüíï. She‚Äôs patient , kind and most of all she listens .",positive
"UPDATED: THEY DID IT AGAIN!! Literally, two times in a row that they canceled after I took off work and notified me **the morning of the appointment**.<br><br>Cancelled my appointment the night before. Instead of sending a text or calling me to let me know of the last-minute change, they sent me a message on the app with a subject line that bore no indication of the cancellation. Given that they had communicated by text about confirming my appointment‚Äîwhen it was. In their interest‚Äîone might think they‚Äôd text when there was an urgent change. Nope. So I took off work, drove all the way down, showed up, and was informed there was no one to see me. Thanks for nothing. Do better.",negative
Dr. Baik was very thorough and communicated well with me. Great service and location.<br>Thank you,positive
"Drew Roenneburg, PA-C-great PA!  He was patient and knowledgeable!!",positive
"This visit was a complete failure and disappointment on so many levels. To start, my PCP, Jennifer, never even introduced herself to me so I did not even know the person I was seeing at first was my PCP. My whole appointment was completely rushed (clearly since we did not even introduce ourselves) and I was out the door within 20 minutes or so. This was my first appointment with this PCP so I certainly expected more care and patience to begin with. I booked an appointment for a physical and was immediately told at the beginning of the appointment that the physical would not be happening because she had to fill out medical records even though I had completed all the required forms beforehand. After briefly covering one of the issues I was having and needed a referral for, I was rushed out the door and told to book another appointment for a physical - even though this appointment was scheduled to be a physical. During my checkout I made it clear that I booked a physical and did not receive one and was frustrated. I should not have to book another appointment, pay another copay, and take time off of work, just to have the physical that I originally booked for. This was completely unprofessional and although I voiced my grievances and frustrations with Jennifer as well as the receptionists, no one took my concerns seriously or initiated any corrective actions. It took another person from One Medical calling me to check back in on an unrelated matter for my concern to be heard and taken seriously. It was also then disclosed that the appointment was being billed as a physical to the insurance even though I clearly did not receive a physical and made it abundantly clear to the receptionist that it cannot and should not be billed as one since I did not receive a physical and did not want to use my yearly physical appointment for a physical I didn't receive. This was a truly awful and mishandled experience. I expected and deserved much more care and respect from all parties involved.",negative
Always quick and courtesy. Love this location!,positive
"This place is a paperwork factory not a doctor's office. They over subscribe their providers and seemingly leave them with very little to no time to actually get to know their patients and their issues. I've had an urgent issue for two weeks and been bounced to three separate providers. They've delayed referrals for urgent scans, so as to get pre authorization my insurance company openly states are not necessary. When they refer you to specialists those people tend to not be taking new patients and it's on you to find your own specialist. The app is nice, the office is nice, but at it's core this place is just about maximizing Bill codes not patients health.",negative
"I've been going here for 4 years and have been impressed with the quality of care and the ease of booking using the app. I also take advantage of video appointments when that's helpful. As a healthcare worker, I've also deeply appreciated the care they've taken during the pandemic. While it's increased wait times, it has also kept the flow of people in the office manageable for staff. All in all when considering the additional benefits of membership, One Medical is worth it!",positive
"I love this place.  I‚Äôve always struggled to find convenient medical care because I travel so much.  One Medical, and this particular site, have made things so consistent & easy.",positive
Very satisfied with the personal service received during my initial appointment.,positive
"Everything you have heard is true. This is by far on the best medical providers I have ever been too. The staff from the time you walk in is friendly. Doctor Sibyl Siegfried who I saw for the first time for a physical was wonderful. I didn't even feel the needle from the lab tech when I drew my blood. The office itself was beautiful and clean, with a wonderfully decorated lobby with plenty of seating. This was by far a very different experience, and a much better one, than other medical visits.",positive
"When you are reaching 62 you have many ways plus the authority of experience to assess the quality of a doctors' office and the colateral services it offers. Being semiretired and having to face the horrible reality of the US health marketplace, i can only say this: One Medical is how the present should be. A model of a doctors office. Great communication, true concern, prompt response, utter respect for you as a patient, and a positive demeanor from the first counter to the last email. Punctuality then, comes as a plus. Refreshing and admirable.",positive
"The doctors are great, but the administration had taken a sharp decline. I just waited over an hour for a blood draw and flu shot. The whole point of the $200 membership fee is that there are short wait times.<br><br>Honestly, at this point, I'm paying for the privilege to pay to see my doctor. It's kind of absurd, and as much as I love my doctor, I'm considering canceling.",negative
"I had two visits.   Fist was great.  Second was not.  Both were basic physicals.  The check-up procedures were not the same between the two and the billing was messed up on the second.  Also the wait times on the second were much longer than first. So: not detail oriented,  care quality varies, poor record keeping, horrible customer service. I'll be picking a new provider next year.",negative
"Five stars isn't enough! I don't write many reviews here, but I'm continuously amazed by how wonderful the services provided by one medical are. I am a woman in my late 20's and while I'm reasonably healthy, I have a few mild to moderately annoying health issues. I decided to sign up for one medical because they are convenient to my office and I can see someone same day if I am not feeling well. Since joining in a few months ago, I've been blown away by how great and comprehensive the care has been. When I wasn't feeling well they saw me immediately, actually listened to my concerns, provided great care, and followed up quickly and clearly. They are the most organized and thoughtful group of medical professionals I've ever encountered. When I had a brief health scare, they scheduled me for a follow up within a week of diagnosis and after I expressed anxiety with the scheduler I was called by both an incredibly knowledgeable and empathetic nurse practitioner AND MY DOCTOR to help me feel secure, cared for, and informed.<br><br>The mobile app is great (and works better than any app I've seen from Aetna, care first, or united healthcare). All messages and lab results come right to my phone and I get a notification when I have a new message. If I have questions about a treatment I can email a nurse at any time either using my personal email or the app and someone from one medical, be it a nurse or my PCP Dr Jillian Noyes herself email me back within about 24 hours.<br><br>Most recently two encounters have reaffirmed my love for this office. The first was when I went to see a specialist at my doctors referral. When I arrived I realized that I had forgotten to print my referral. As I was asking if I could forward my referral email, they asked if I was coming from one medical and pulled out a referral that had already been faxed for me! The second was when I was talking with an old friend and she told me that she'd found a new doctor that she loved. Before I'd over told her that I had also switched primary care physicians, she asked ""have you heard about one medical, they are incredible!""<br><br>Since joining One Medical, I have referred them to all of my closest friends. I cannot thank them enough for the outstanding service. I'm sure that I will be a patient of theirs for years to come.",positive
"I love one medical. They have the best service, are always on time, get back to me via app message and emails quickly. They truly make the experience of visiting the doctor much easier on the patient. I also appreciate that they have a bloodwork facility right on site and it's just one person at a time. Not like those other labs where the patient is just a number.",positive
"I love this place so much that even after my insurance wasn't accepted, I paid out of pocket to go there!  There has only been 1 time where I had to wait for 5 minutes for my appointment to start and they gave me a Starbucks gift card as an apology. I've seen several of the Drs and nurses and all have been extremely helpful, kind and present.",positive
"I have been with One Medical for several years. They have made health care more accessible for me. When appointments occur as scheduled and I can communicate with a health care provider 24 hours a day, I access the service more rather than waiting until symptoms get worse before seeing a doctor. The office and medical staff are professional and friendly.",positive
"I have been a subscriber for two years. I have never had a problem with the staff, PAs, NPs or MDs. However, when I received an erroneous bill last month, I could not get through to a person via the admin chat thread in the app (or website on my laptop) nor could I reach a person in the NJ Ave office when I called their 202 line listed above. It defaulted to One Medical‚Äôs general line‚Äîwhich I called last week to inquire about the bill. I waited an hour to get a person on the phone last week and forty minutes to get, as it turns out, the same person who remembered our original conversation. Last week she told me my insurance was billed, according to her computer, and they did not receive an insurance payment. I told her I only owe a copay and she agreed. She asked me to call my insurance company to inquire about it. I thought to myself: why do I pay a membership fee? I asked her to do it on my behalf and she said she would. I never received an update. Today, I called my insurance first to confirm that they never received a bill from One Medical (they had not). When I asked the OneMedical rep about it, she said she had spoken with someone at my insurance co. who said she would follow up and did not indicate yea or nay whether they received a bill. When I informed her that I also spoke with someone and the answer was definitely ‚Äòno,‚Äô I asked her to resubmit the request. She was perfectly polite both times I spoke with her but she is clearly inexperienced with medical billing (or overwhelmed‚Äîhow could I get the same c/s rep twice?) The bottom line is I pay $199 per year for what seems like a nice office to visit with relatively easy access to a provider (but not often an appt with a provider of my choice). Furthermore, I have to spend additional time trying to correct someone else‚Äôs mistake. So, where is the value in One Medical? I‚Äôm cancelling my membership as soon as I get the correct amount on this bill paid and rolling the dice with a regular primary care practice again.",negative
One Medical has amazing healthcare professionals on staff and the absolute BEST administrative staff anywhere.,positive
"I LOVE this place! Beautiful, relaxing waiting area with good music, helpful staff, and wifi...although you don't spend much time there. The appointments run on time so I barely had to wait.

"I started seeing Dr Felicia Patel at Capitol Hill for Internal Medicine 3 years ago. I chose her as my doctor following the reviews she had on the website. My experience with her has been wonderful. She is a highly knowledgeable doctor. She listens to her patients, suggests various advice that is tailored to their lifestyle. She is very understanding and supportive. I feel well taken care of having her as my provider.<br><br>She also has an impeccable sense of humor :)<br>We need more physicians like Dr. Patel!",positive

I went yesterday to the Capitol Hill Medical Records office and I was so happy to see Mariella was working at the desk. It was the second time I see her.

"A huge shout out to the entire staff, nurses, anesthesiologist and Dr Ghouse on their service, bedside manners and care of my son for his endoscopy. The nurse who put the IV in was very gentle and kept him distracted by engaging with him while easing his nerves. The anesthesiologist was awesome! I totally forgot his name but he has the best personality and clearly communicated everything so we could understand. It was comforting knowing that he was in there with my son. Dr Ghouse was amazing. He explained to us what he was going to do and took the time after the procedure to speak with me and bring me pictures of the lining of his stomach.<br><br>I also got text notifications when he went in the procedure room and when he was out of it. I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt want to drive to Capital Hill but the staff and doctors were great.<br><br>Some tips. If your coming from Nova, don‚Äôt go 395 just take Constitution Ave all the way to Union Station. I find it easier to go through DC than get on 395.<br><br>Covid tests are required before procedures and have to be done no more than 48 hours. I was able to get that done in Woodbridge through the drive through. Results were given before we made it home.<br><br>Thanks again to everyone who helped my son today. I really appreciate the time you spent with him. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",positive

Thanks Dr Panea and Teresa.<br><br>Ms. Karen at the front desk in podiatry provided excellent customer service. Even though clients checked in downstairs she still followed thru to make sure they were on the right location. 3 out of 5 were not.

"I had an appointment with cardiology Capital Hill 10/21/24 at 4:15pm. I checked in with the receptionist Carolyn at 4:15:02pm. She was very rude, aggresive and nasty. I paid my $20 copay and after paying she told me to go wait in the lobby. I waited in the lobby until 5:28pm, and nobody had called me back. I tried knocking on the door and nobody answered. Finally, a guy who works for kaiser walking through saw the concerned look on my face and asked if i needed help. I explained to him my dilema and showed him my receipt. He went back to see if anybody was there and could not find anybody. Finally, we went downstairs to the first floor receptionist who asked for my medical record number. Once she looked me up in the system she ended up telling me that Carolyn, the receptionist never even checked me in fully. I waited and waited due to her unprofessionalism and horrible work ethic. Ontop of it all, Kaiser was ok taking my money for the copay but service was NEVER rendered. Additionally this was a very important procedure i needed to have done.

Dr. Yousef the anesthesiologist was very thorough and ensured any questions we had were answered.  The whole team did everything they could to make sure my 3 year old son was comfortable and he left after having his endoscopy saying he had fun‚Ä¶ which I didn‚Äôt even think was possible.  We drove a ways to get to this center and after we left I thought to myself‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve driven further to see that team of caring, professionals.  An amazing experience!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",positive

We had a great experience at the Capitol Hill pediatrics cardiology department. The entire staff was super-friendly and so professional throughout our visit. Nurse Emmy was gentle with my newborn daughter and explained all of her actions throughout the examination. Our Ultrasound Technician Ms. Beth was so knowledgeable and and helpful during the baby‚Äôs ultrasound. She was a baby whisperer and even had a trick or two that soothed the baby during the lengthy exam. She even had calming kids classical music on during the ultrasound. Dr. Mitchell was awesome as well and truly attentive to our medical concerns. My husband and I were impressed with all aspects of the appointment and thankful for a wonderful experience on such a serious matter.,positive
"The GI team at Capitol Hill is top tier. This was my first colonoscopy and to say I was very anxious is an understatement. Nurse Alex explained everything in detail even documenting the time I needed to complete my prep. He went above and beyond and I am so grateful , he made me feel so comfortable. Nurse Lola and my entire team in the procedure room exceeded my expectation's. Dr. Sharma was wonderful and took the time before my procedure to answer any questions I may have had and she helped to calm me down as well. Nurse Annette helped me to my car and that again shows what type of awesome teamwork they have. The GI team works together to take exceptional care of each patient and I will forever be grateful the role each of them played in my first Colonoscopy !!",positive
Dr Cobb with Kaiser orthopedic department provides the most attentive medical care.

"I want to recognize an amazing assistant in the General surgery department. Her name is Rhonda and I will be forever grateful for her. I recently had a surgery in a very private area and anything I needed, she made sure to help to her best abilities. Literally holding my hand and coaching me as I was going through a very intense procedure.  This healing recovery has been one of the most painful experiences in my life. As a registered nurse myself, I admire and respect people like this who work in healthcare. She has been the best person I‚Äôve had to take care of my needs since I‚Äôve become an RN. I also would like the recognize and thank my nurse Julan who helped me when I needed help to manage my pain. The whole department including the receptionist is great- truly!",positive
"Clinical assistant (Mia) called me back w/in 5 mins of checking in on the kiosk. After getting my weight we came into an exam room where she completed the rest of my vitals. What I really appreciated was her going through my proactive care plan sheet to inform me that I had outstanding labs. She was kind, funny and patient (blood pressure reading was high and needed to be taken twice). She asked about factors that could‚Äôve influenced my high bp reading and we enjoyed a good laugh about the insanely high sodium laden dinner I described having had the night before : ) she was professional and personable like my PCP. Glad to have a great healthcare team!",positive
"I had an ultrasound appointment today and I‚Äôve had others scheduled in the past at KP Cap Hill, but none to warrant me leaving a review. But today‚Äôs appointment‚Ä¶ was the best care I have had at KP Cap Hill. My sonographer/ultrasound tech, Alina, was beyond professional! She was charismatic, funny, very communicative throughout my entire appointment , and just an overall joy. You can tell she enjoys her job and is the kind of person we need working in the healthcare industry! I was already having a good day, but Alina made it great.

Please continue to keep that positive attitude! KP.. give that woman a raise!!",positive
"Everything about this location is terrible and in general I‚Äôve had poor experiences with kaisers app, their customer service, and the ‚Äúget care now‚Äù feature.<br><br>Whenever i try to make an appointment it‚Äôs like jumping through hoops and ladders. OBGYN? Not available for two months. PCP? Never shows availability on the app, you have to call. Dermatologist? The PCP will middle man you. I wanted to see a dermatologist for roseacia treatment, sent a couple photos, and was looking forward to seeing someone in person. Instead, the PCP never connected me with the dermatologist and said that i was prescribed some cream and an antibiotic. Prescribing antibiotics without seeing the patient is odd to me.<br><br>Last year i was pregnant and couldn‚Äôt book an appointment with the obgyn until my 2nd trimester thanks to their terrible availability. All of the messaging on Kaisers website and in the posters in their centers talk about contacting asap and setting up prenatal care, ‚Äúwe care about your time‚Äù, etc. apparently not in real life.<br><br>Fast forward a couple weeks and i had a miscarriage. The lady on the phone told me to go to urgent care. Sat in urgent care for 7 hours on a Friday evening then was asked to come back Saturday morning for an ultrasound. I was promised we‚Äôd be in and out quickly since i already waited so long Friday. We came in first thing Saturday and spent 4 hours sitting in the wait room after the sonogram. I had already received the results of the sonogram in my Kaiser app. They moved us just to a room and we waited another hour. When i stopped a doctor to ask what the hold up was, she basically yelled at me and said there were people sicker than me and they prioritize people by sickness. I said i was told we wouldn‚Äôt be waiting today since we waited so long yesterday and that if that‚Äôs their system they should be upfront about it. A doctor could have followed up on the phone about the results of the ultrasound and i could be in the comfort of my home having a miscarriage instead of sitting in the waiting room at urgent care. The doctor that we spoke to shortly afterwards couldn‚Äôt even read an ultrasound and we had to talk to the obgyn on the phone the following Monday.<br><br>Now I‚Äôm sitting here again waiting to be seen for some spider bites that are swollen and red and inflamed. The wait time is said to be 2 hours, but who knows how long it will actually be, and if i actually get treated today. Apparently serious looking spider bites are less of a priority than a miscarriage!<br><br>Update - after 2.5 hours waiting, the urgent care doctor said the sores on my arm looked like shingles to her and sent me home with a course of antivirals. I‚Äôm not a doctor but four blisters on my arm and hand didn‚Äôt seem like shingles to me. I sent photos to my PCP via the app and she agreed it wasn‚Äôt shingles. Can‚Äôt believe i spent $50 and 3 hours at the urgent care to be misdiagnosed with something like shingles. No one has figured out what it was and now it‚Äôs resolving on its own. I‚Äôm never going to that urgent care again.",negative

She was not only friendly and helpful in person but also displayed exceptional politeness when she called me. Her courteous manner on the phone made scheduling and managing appointments a breeze. Karen's professionalism and kindness truly enhanced my experience at Kaiser Capital Hill.<br><br>Miss Annette, the charge nurse at Kaiser Capital Hill,  played a pivotal role during my visit. Her caring demeanor and attention to detail made a world of difference for both me and my son.

She exemplifies the highest standards of nursing and made a challenging experience much more manageable. Kaiser is fortunate to have such a dedicated professional on their team.<br><br>Thank you, Miss Annette, for your outstanding support and kindness.

Her friendly demeanor and easy communication style made my recovery period comfortable and enjoyable.",positive
"First thing appointment. Everybody is probably just waking up. But the intake nurse Mia was in great spirits and had me laughing my rear end off.

"Horrible ....checked in 1 hour ago, in pain, level 10 and still haven't been seen. A nurse Stacy Searcy, has no patience, and rude AF. They're short staffed and the patients are suffering unnecessarily,  I've asked for pain medication three times, nothing yet an hour and a half . Stacy's excuse/reason was this just how it is.

"I‚Äôve never had one complaint against the doctors and staff that assist me in my visits. Just this morning I was greeted by Mia in Internal Medicine for my appointment. She was friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs such a joy to be met with someone like her. It gives me hope that the rest of my day will be great!<br><br>The only complaint I really have is desk staff, particularly down by labs and emergency care. They‚Äôre not the friendliest nor the nicest but I guess that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre dealing with so many people. I prefer to just figure out my question myself or wait until I‚Äôm in labs to ask it. I asked one question to the desk staff near labs about getting my parking validated and it was like I asked them to pull my car up to the front.",positive

Scheduled MRI in beginning of July for August 19. They canceled it 2 days before the appointment day without stating a reason.<br>Called for rescheduling.

"I still can not get any response from this organization. Their phone systems have a generic message. All extensions have the same foolish message. I sent an email, no response.

The lab ladies especially were so sweet.<br><br>I was worried I have a kidney stone (or strep that went to my kidney, thanks to all my friends for the horror stories) and it hurt enough to keep me up all night.  They did all the labs, swabs, and a CT to find out what was causing the pain.  Turns out it was just a well pinched nerve.<br><br>I highly recommend going here enough if you're on the fence about it.

If I got there at 6:30pm, or waited even until 8pm, I think it would've gone much faster.

The nurse who checked me out (African American male) and the guy who wheeled me to the car (African American male), were also excellent in their roles - ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è sorry, but I did not get their names). Such an awesome team!! And, KUDOS to Vanessa, my ASL Interpreter - she ALWAYS does an outstanding job!! Thank you, everyone!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô<br><br>Highly recommended (as Ms. Helen Baylor would sing)!<br>MGoodwin",positive

"Karla (mammo) and Kianna (US) were amazing. I was told I needed additional testing for a suspicious area seen on my test from the day before. They were completely booked and there was no appointment available till 12/16. They both worked on fitting me into their busy schedules and reassuring me that most times further testing comes back negative.  Thankfully everything was fine, but I cannot imagine waiting over 2 weeks to find that out. Especially when I  was unable to sleep the night before after getting the message about my test..<br>A huge shout out to both of them. You are not told often enough how very appreciated you are.<br>THANK YOU!!",positive
"I am writing to draw attention to the poor service that Kaiser Permanente has been providing to its members. As a Kaiser member since January 1988, I have observed how the quality of the services have diminished over the years. I understand the Pandemic may have reduced Kaiser‚Äôs staffing but, they should consider how this endangers their members and staff.<br><br>This is the beginning of open season and every other commercial on television is from Kaiser trying to recruit new members. But how can they make a call for new members when they are not adequately supporting the ones they currently have. What happened to the Kaiser Motto:  We Care, We Advocate, We Give, We Thrive?<br><br>How can they say they care when they are overworking staff to the point that it damages the relationships between doctors and their patients?<br><br>How can they say they support their members when they are not providing truthful information to members about services?<br>How can they say they are giving the best service to members when it can take anywhere from two (2) to four (4) months to get an appointment despite members still having to pay for the services we‚Äôre not receiving?<br><br>What are members to do in case of emergency? Going to Urgent Care is a short-term fix that only results in being told to ‚Äúfollow up with your doctor‚Äù; so, members are right back where we started in trying to get an appointment in the first place.<br><br>Here are just a few examples of Kaiser‚Äôs poor business practices that I have observed over the last year:<br>On Kaiser‚Äôs commercials, they don‚Äôt mention that there is currently a waiting period of two (2) to four (4) months to get an appointment and that depends on the doctor and procedure for an appointment. Kaiser also does not mention that when members send a message, we may receive a response, or we may not.<br><br>Kaiser‚Äôs commercials also don‚Äôt mention that there is not coverage in some areas, because they are always moving them around. Kaiser is also overwhelming their staff. This is apparent in how doctors are only allotting patients a twenty (20) minute time frame during their visit. How is this enough time for doctors to hear what patients have going on and accurately diagnose the issue in all cases?<br><br>Kaiser, I ask you this: Are you a company that provides excellent care and services to its members or a company recognized by membership numbers? Do better!",negative
"I went to Washington medical on April 18th and it was 8:30pm when we got there we left around 2am in the morning and still hadn‚Äôt been seen. We left and went to Kaiser Urgent Care a day later. Came at 1pm and was seen immediately. Had to stay longer due to blood pressure. Had my own room, bed and privacy. Clean facility, people were nice and friendly. Will never go to emergency room if I can help it. Excellent service.",positive
"When arriving Nai, RN greeted us down the hall w/ a hug and smile. We walked into the clinic and then was teamed triaged by Dianna and Nai which they showed much compassion. Dr. Isfort was prompt waiting on us as we walked into the room with a bright smile üòä . She was very informative and patient to answer all questions. My daughter and self both received the flu vaccine by Shanelle, RN and Dianna whom again came in the room to comfort us with bright smiles. Our morning appointment was great with the Endocrine team and my daughter definitely felt the compassion and love.",positive
The procedure was smoother than I was expecting.<br>Doctor Barney was very friendly. She made me to feel confident as soon as I met her. Thank you for your professionalism.,positive
"The facility is clean and the staff are welcoming. The security guard on the first level by the elevators was very helpful and sweet. Walking to the department everyone greeted us with a smile. The receptionist, Ms. Marshall was warming and her positive spirit was exactly what we needed this morning. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",positive
"I have had an ongoing issue for about a week. Each time I went to the urgent care the care and time the staff took to make sure I was getting the care I needed was great. I attempted to take care of it at home but could not take it anymore. From the front desk staff Alexis, Michelle, and Lauren treated me with care. The doctor‚Äôs Dr. N, Dr Ofodile, Dr. Preston, Dr. Yimen, and Dr. Miller made sure I was getting everything I needed to correct the problem. The nurses Kelsey, Uchechi, Ogie, Eze, Kelley thank you for all you do Yhe staff in General Surgery thank you for making the procedure process easy by calming my nerves and reassuring me that I would be fine! Healthcare professionals do not get enough recognition for the work they do day in and day out to make sure patients are taken care of, just know from me you are appreciated!! I am on the road to recovery and I thank the staff at Capitol Hill Kaiser Permanente!!",positive
"I wouldn't visit this KP if you have a deductible plan. When i had a copay plan, an eye exam cost $25 for the copay. I really liked my optician so I scheduled an appointment with my new plan and i got an estimate that said the visit would cost $300+ which is so astronomically high I called to confirm it was accurate. The person i talked to said if I was just getting my prescription updated the cost would be around $80 which was still higher than most places without insurance but I liked my optometrist and the location was on my way to work so i was willing to pay a bit more for the convenience. I confirmed with my doctor ahead of time that this appointment was only to update my prescription and no other tests would be done and she confirmed that was correct and that's what my appointment was. A few days later i received the bill and the eye exam itself cost $40 which was even less than I was quoted and was happy to see, but then I noticed there was an  additional $113 ""hospital charge"". No one from member services could explain what the charge was or why I it applied to my visit but it quadrupled the cost of using KP and was double the cost of basically any other optometrist in the area *without insurance*. I had to write an official letter of dispute and it was denied (again with no explanation of what the charge was or why no one mentioned in the multiple phone calls I had about the cost of the appointment). It was such a bad experience I'm leaving KP after being a member for almost 30 years!",negative
"I want to express how happy I am with the Pediatric Subspecialty Department and my son‚Äôs care. Over the last month, I have encountered some very patient, amazing bedside manner, responsive   nurses & technicians! But I want to specifically highlight Nakia Riley, Shanelle Faison, and Nurse Rebecca.<br><br>These women have been so patient, kind, and thorough with my son and his care for Sickle Cell. When my son sees Nakia, he is immediately excited and not afraid to do his routine blood work. Today, Shanelle quickly evaluated and educated me that my son needs a longer catheter for her veins when he needs an IV. Nurse Rebecca assisted me with scheduling appts for a routine screening and was so patient with me while I was being a nervous wreck.<br><br>The thoughtfulness these women have shown while dealing with a frantic mom (me) whose son has Sickle Cell goes to show that they take their careers seriously and really care about their patients! I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better team to take care of him. Thank you ladies for everything!",positive
